  "self_text": "Hey everyone just wanted to make an announcement about some changes to the sub: A new Rule, a highly requested change to an existing one, and a (future) call for new moderators interested in helping the sub.\n\nA little backstory first: I came to the sub about a year and a half ago and was told \"as a heads up we are more lenient here than the r/leagueoflegends sub\" that I came from. What I didn't realize at the time was that it meant the sub mostly went unmoderated. I spent the whole of last year being basically the only mod until eventually the decision was made to remove everyone inactive and make me the top mod. (Thank you that one random comment on r/CompetitiveTFT for giving me the motivation to clean the sub up)\n\nFast forward to today and I'm now the only mod here but I've still been largely operating based on the previous existing rules and haven't got around to making any big changes outside of the creation of Salty Sunday rules. I now come bearing the next new rule (though it's not as big as Salty Sunday)\n\n> **New Rule**\n\n> Vague, contextless, memetic, or inaccurate titles are not allowed. Titles should represent or describe the content of a post.\n\n> Single word titles or titles that are majority capital letters are not allowed.\n\nThis new rule is mainly just to cut down on the occasional low effort type post that mainly plagues meme subs. Posts like \"title\" \"I made this\" \"Yone\" etc are pretty much universally trash.\n\n**Update to an Existing rule**\n\nDid you know that thanks to Fortune you can get multiple copies of the same 3 star 5 cost unit? If you didn't before then you must have missed the daily posts asking how it happened. I've updated the FAQ to include this under the Common Set-Specific Mechanics rule. Please comment any additional mechanics you feel should be included in the FAQ as what's obviously a common mechanic to me may not be the same as what others find common.\n\nEdit: also adding Fortune to rule 10. We've had enough posts about Fortune 7 & 9. Now you need to have at least 12 fortune or something otherwise special about your board.\n\n**A (future) call for more moderators**\n\nPutting this out there now so that anyone who would be interested can start thinking about the idea. I don't have the time at the moment to really go through a new mod selection process because of work but in the near future when I'm not killing myself with overtime shifts I'll sit down and go through the process. Would be really helpful if someone familiar with automod was interested in joining as I've heavily relied on automod and Reddit's opt - in filtering system and I realize it's catching a lot of false positives.\n\nThis sub will always have a more casual vibe to it, we aren't r/CompetitiveTFT and I have no desire to lead the sub in a direction that fills the same space as it. That sub will always be the better sub for discussion about meta, game balance, high elo play, etc. But this sub should also not be known as a dumpster fire that should be actively avoided either. Because this sub attracts more casual players, low ranked players, etc it'll always have a skew towards having some... \"questionable\" takes but the sub should still be a place people can come to and share their love for the game without being drowned in a sea of low effort posts.\n\nHave a good day everyone and if you have any feedback for the direction of the sub please comment here",

I don't think anyone has to feel an inferiority complex toward a subreddit where people have more game knowledge, sure, but not enough to be considered good or respectable at this point. When I used to play ranked seriously, I would see some under-the-radar comps here that no one was posting about over there, and there were many times where the other sub couldn't successfully predict meta or see obvious outliers that were being posted and ignored them instead. So it's not that good. As you mentioned, this main sub attracts more casual players who are trying to have fun, so you will get more casual and low elo posts naturally.\n\nBut I do agree with the titles thing where people abuse vague and unrelated titles to improve the memeability of their posts. But it's also a part of making memes, so it could reduce the quality or engagement of meme posts."

      "comment_body": "Many people seem to hate set 10 just because of headliners, but it was well balanced, tons of fun comps. It was my first set and I found it extremely fun. Do I miss headliners? Not exactly. But they were a really fun way to play heartsteel.\n\nI loved playing heartsteel (econ trait) AD flex, which meant I had to use the headliner mechanic to its fullest potential. Rolling down on 8 for a good headliner meant you had to use whatever good headliner you get. It felt like every game I had to be a little creative in making my comp, because if my headliner is Caitlyn vs Ezreal vs poppy vs zed vs zac, my game goes a little differently.\n\nI also really liked 2-cost reroll AP (senna, seraphine), at least when first learning this game and first learning the set. Pretty simple gameplan to learn the game and all the items.\n\nI think mostly it was just the variety of comps, though. You could play riven reroll (8-bit), pentakill standard/fast 8, pentakill 2-cost reroll (kayle), twisted fate disco (was nerfed before I joined tft but still fine with the right spot), Punk (which a lot of people hated but I liked that it was kinda a \"can you outcap 1-cost reroll\" check), twin terror executioners, twin terror lulu, country 3-costs (samira, urgot), crowd-diver reroll (katarina), true damage yasuo reroll 1-costs, and more depending on the spot. You could probably search any of these in youtube and see clips.\n\nAnd the music.... man it was amazing. Even this set, I sometimes mute the in-game music put on the set 10 soundtrack on youtube because it's that good.\n\nWere there problems? yes. I personally didn't like when playing reroll and hitting the wrong +1 trait on your headliner. (headliners give a +1 of one of your traits, randomly). That's a terrible feeling. But it forces you to play a little more flexible (can't JUST roll for true damage senna, you have to sometimes accept rapidfire senna, or even KDA seraphine since that's also 2-cost AP reroll)"

It forced players to play full flex, both AP and AD at the same time if you want to avoid that RNG. But, lo and behold, the TFT community is full of people who like to commit to something and no scout no pivot. So, that part of the community absolutely despised the set(get good)."

Pretty much every trait had its time in the sun, and you could top 4 with almost anything if you were skilled enough to know how to make it work. The set overall rewarded smart and flexible play.\n\nThe inclusion of \"headliners\" also gave an extra +1 to a trait and an immediate 2 star unit, so it made it much easier to hit a 3* carry and to hit the higher verticals in any given trait without having to roll forever. It also added to the flexibility in some comps since if you got +1 to a certain trait on your headliner, then you could sub out the usual unit needed to activate that trait in your comp for something else a little more powerful or creative.\n\nThe headliner thing was pretty controversial because it had its pros and cons like anything else, but it was something unique and fresh for the game, kind of like the encounters in the current set."

Headliner mechanic is one of my favorites too despite people hating it. Imagine going into a game being able to play a strong opener until 3-2 without committing to a comp because it was so easy to pivot into anything that was viable to top 4, than try to cap out late. This set its dominated by a few comps, the current patch seems to be the best so far though."

      "comment_body": "I dropped set 4 because the Chosen mechanic (old Headliner mechanic) was just too difficult for me to get my head around at the time and I also really got into Valorant around that time. But then when I tried the Headliner mechanic in Set 10, it made sense to me once I spent a little more time understanding it. It's honestly not a bad mechanic imo. There weren't too many circumstances where I just didn't hit. The set was also really flexible precisely because of the HL mechanic. Since one unit counts for two of the same trait, you could always add in stuff to round out your composition, since you need one less unit to do it.\n\nThe same can't be said of Set 11 where, if you're missing 1 Storyweaver, you're just shit out of luck.\n\nFor Set 10, a ton of stuff was viable, I don't care what anyone else says. I've never played so many different comps in one set and I pretty much NEVER went Fast 8/9. Comparatively in Set 11, other than the initial Senna/Shen, Volibear, Yone, some Gnar reroll, it's been almost completely Fast 8/9s for me. I played Fated as I was climbing, but once I got around Plat, it got impossible to play, because Fast 8 boards just overwhelmed it.\n\nSet 10 felt balanced as well. Any comp I had felt like it could go at least top 4 if I played it correctly and I was getting beaten by all kinds of stuff that made me think 'that's cool, I want to try that' and I could understand why I lost to it. But when it comes to Set 11, I don't even know how to gauge the power levels of anything.\n\nLissandra is just so BS, much worse than K'sante was a couple of sets ago. I've never seen so many 3-star 5 costs in a set. I have seen more 3-star 5-costs in Set 11 than I have in every set I've played combined (3, 5, 7, 9, 10). \n\nIt took me a lot longer to climb to Emerald in Set 10 than it did for me in Set 11, but that's because the path to victory in Set 11 is so limited in my opinion. Early board doesn't matter, just play anything strong, eco, go Fast 8, roll down and see what 4-cost carries you hit, go 9 and roll for Peeba comp. The only other comps to play are just if you hit something really good like Dryad opener with Titan's Resolve + some really good complementary augment. Set 10 was much more varied and I had to play what I was given.\n\nI won't say it's all been bad obviously, lots of fun stuff too like specific hero augments like Kobuko, Garen or Shen augment. But that stuff's few and far between."

No chosen so you can actually hit 4 costs when contested. No chosen so +1 traits are back. Traits this set are ACTUALLY FUN and ACTUALLY DO THINGS. The only \"bad\" 5 cost this set is funny enough Sett.

First pick in 2nd carousel and picked up a Morgana, went 7 at 3-5, rolled about 16 gold (down to 20) and found one copy of Sylas which somewhat stabilized me. Went 8 at 4-3 (off tempo but all I could afford lol) and rolled to 0, which stabilized just enough for a 4th. \n\nIn summary, maybe light rolling at 7 around whatever you pick up in carousel is the way to salvage a 4th/5th from a weak stage 2 & 3, if your board is giga trash going into stage 3 (no pairs). Rolling on 3-1 or 3-2 prolly makes sense if you’re holding 2 or 3 cost pairs. I think waiting till 4-5 for 8 is fine on this patch (if you’re flexible and willing to play around what’s left in the pool) since people are less likely to stabilize rolling on 4-2.\n\nFor Sage Sylas, when I’m contested, I know that my “other outs” are Annie/Nautilus/Udyr/Rakan for Sylas items, Lillia/Hwei/Azir for Morgana. Figuring out the same for your default comp might help you avoid the “straight up dead” scenarios."

If 4 costs are barely overturned then it slants even harder and whole patch is fast 8? Doesn't that sound like, a game design flaw?\n\n\nWith other games, let's say magic the gathering, they have stuff like aggro, midrange, and control. If aggro gets too overturned then midrange rises as the natural counter. If midrange gets overturned, control gets a little stronger also as a natural counter. This game feel uniquely different in that if 4 costs are strong, it incentives everyone to go even harder on 4 costs. Almost like in mtg if aggro was ever too strong, if it incentivised the whole format to go in even harder into aggro that seems like a huge design flaw. The most minor of imbalancez would be exasperated as meta shifting."

      "comment_body": "I have no problem with microtransaction for specific items but I absolutely despise any kind of predatory mechanic like gacha. The moment this shit was introduced to TFT i stopped spending a single euro on league/tft because regardless of what people say (\"TFT needs revenue to continue\", \"just don't buy it if it isn't for you LOL\") it is wrong to do it. I have no gambling problem, I could easily afford it, but these monetization strategies pray on the whales and give ZERO fuck about people with less self control or customers as whole. Yet I don't blame anyone for spending money on it because that would be quite hypocritical after I spend around 500€ since 2011 on League.\n\nThey even nerfed the seasons passes to a point where the content you receive is absolutely laughable AND THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE and lied to our faces how the new content is \"more valuable\". Its utter fucking garbage and the ONLY REASON they did it is so you, as a customer, are forced to engage with the gacha mechanic, tempting you to invest more (milestone mechanic) because you already did it \"for free\".\n\nFor years now, Riot is milking league players while barely improving core problems but yet somehow are able to innovate on monetization. They even complied to legal safeguards and regulations (showing odds for example), yet keep inventing new digital currencies to obfuscate the amount of money you spend.\n\nThe only upside is that legal regulators in many countries are now getting aware of these problems and likely will introduce more policies on how microtransaction can/cant be used to generate revenue. Obviously that will take years but it has already started."

For the KDA map, I got lucky and got it on the second roll, but still 350 Euros down for the Kai'Sa. But since the Chibi and the map have been released, I have not spent any euros on any Riot product but have played a ton of TFT. \n\nSo TFT has, in my opinion, run into a monetization problem that you have just a tiny amount of cosmetics that will not change by in-game mechanics. League of Legends, for example, has 165 Champs or something and will release new skins for 5 champs or something like every 2 weeks. Players are not playing only one champ (some will only play one), so they are buying skins for the champions they play, and maybe there are some meta changes, or the player switches the role, or just learns a new champion and enjoys it and buys a skin for the champion. This is a never-ending cycle: new champs with skins, new meta champs I want to play, players that want a cool skin for the champion that they are playing, repeat. It's basically like a subscription that is funding, LoL. \n\nBut TFT cosmetics are not part of the new feature loop. The TFT team is building new sets, but they are just investing. Nothing will change on the monetization side; a new set will not give you an incentive to buy something for the new set.  So TFT has increased the price of cosmetics because they are probably driving on a way longer spending \"dry streak\" from each player. Instead of the LOL player that spends 20 Euros a month or something, they are selling one-time big prices like the 200 Euro Chibis, because they know the incentive of buying the Chibis after you get your favourite one is low.\n\nValorant, for example, is in the middle, not having an infinite amount of weapons but still more than the Little Legend and a map. So, prices are in the 35-euro range for one cosmetic (prices can differ depending on the type of weapon and rarity of the cosmetic). \n\nFor me, if we use the dumb method of 1 Euro or USD for 1 hour of gameplay, I have gotten my money out of TFT.\n\nFor the gambling side, yes, this is problematic. I always count with the end price, so ask myself first: is spending 350 euros right now fine for me? So if I get the Chibi earlier, lucky I have saved some money, but  I have always calculated with the full amount. For people that have gambling problems the entire system is problematic but in most countries, digital goods gambling is not real gambling, currently Riot can use this addictive method."

Sejuani 2 star did a massive aoe 3.5 second stun.\nYeah that's just set 1 things but even as recent as set 8 and 9 still had long CC abilities. Set 10 and set 11 just have such a major CC draught that it becomes really noticeable when a unit has CC but your kidding yourself if you think Lissandra is one of the best 5 costs in TFT history when she wouldn't even be top 10 in the best 4 costs in TFT history lol"

Even last set melee carries still had to run QSS but this set none of them do since there is barely any CC. You don't really want to build a QSS on your Kayn when 6 out of 7 enemy teams either have no cc or have negligible cc just because the last enemy has a lissandra so you skip the QSS and it becomes frustrating to then go on to see Kayn get potted"

Natural 2 and 3 stars while rolling 0 times. Most Mythic comps just play 3 because 5/7 just feel terrible compared to other options in the meta, 6 Umbral actually feels so much better than 7 Mythic because you actually have units that can act as carry’s(Yone/Alune or Sylas/Alune Duo) whereas in Mythic you need either Kog/Cho/Neeko 3 or Neeko/Bard/Tahm 3 and need very specific items(Wits/2x Guinsoos or Gunblade/2x Guinsoos Bard, BB/Nash/Offensive Ap Kog, Innervating Locket or Forbidden Idol or both on Tahm) \n\nMythic is in my honest opinion worse off than Umbral currently. Umbral wasn’t playable for the longest time(1st patch it was okay before the meta was solved), but at least it has units you can play around if you go the vertical instead of praying around double spat and hyperspecific items/setups."

I'm not a fan of econ traits so I'm neutral on heartsteel.\n\nThe class traits were all over the place with balance and most weren't that interesting either but most of the class traits in sets aren't too exciting.\n\nIn set 11 I find traits like Fated, where you have to choose what extra stats you want, Storyweaver is cool, Heavenly is like Guild which was one of my favorite traits of all time. I think set 11 has some boring ones too though, ghostly and mythic in particular aren't very interesting to me.

A trickshot for bard or an invoker for Lillia, you need something to make them more than just statted up vanilla units. The other bard guy had a 2 star kaisa along with his bard to increase dps for example. 2* Hwei isn't strong enough to hard carry by itself unfortunately. Your bard is fine item-wise, but lower in dps than what the double guinsoo or wit' end versions provide, and it's unclear if you have a strong lillia or not.\n\nSo looking at the other comps, it's not surprising how you ended up placing so low.\n\n1st place has a 3* Lee with what appears to be full 8 duelists...no way anyone is beating that without their own 3* 4 cost or better.\n\n2nd place is porcelain invoker, one of the most efficient top comps in the meta. Not a surprise it did well. Out of all the things in this lobby, this is probably the only one you can possibly complain about as being OP and needing nerfs.\n\n3rd place was an endgame board built around 2* Liss and Azir, both with good items and active synergies. \n\n4th place was an uncontested Umbral player with fully itemized carries. They probably got online faster than you and had enough damage on relevant units to contend with the better boards for longer.\n\nYou and 5th place both contested each other for mythic, likely slowing down your spikes, and neither of you have enough combat augments to juice up your boards strength against stronger boards.\n\n6th place played a good comp but has sub-par items and must have low-rolled a bit to spike too late.

When x is greater than 272 then the left side (Syndra bonus) is stronger. Only considering damage from Syndra's ability and not autos.\n\nIf you do happen to have other sources of bonus damage (ex: Rabadon's Deathcap, Giant Slayer, Blue Buff, Know Your Enemy, etc.) then Syndra's Fated bonus becomes a relatively worse choice. With Blue Buff active for example, this would be 295 AP needed for Syndra's bonus to overtake Ahri's bonus in terms of damage. Logically this is because bonus damage stacks additively. \n\n`(1 + 0.11 * a + b)(x) > (1 + b)(x + 30 * a)`\n\nb is the amount of bonus damage active (15% bonus damage = 0.15)\n\nConsidering that Blue Buff and Rabadon's are very common Syndra items, this makes the hurdle even steeper. With both items bonus damage active, it comes out to a 349 AP threshold. Though of course with those 2 items Syndra has at least 170 AP already and you at least have 2 Arcanist so 190 AP.\n\nThen the other question is whether extra shielding versus Syndra HP. Syndra 2* has 1620 HP so 20% bonus HP is 324 HP. You might have an item which gives HP but let's just ignore that for now for simplicity. Thresh 2* has 400 AP scaling on the shield, so that's an extra 240x2 effective HP per cast with Ahri 5 Fated or 360x2 HP with 7 Fated. Thresh shields both himself and the lowest HP unit which is why there is a 2x multiplier there. If you get full value out of the shields, then clearly Thresh is better, though of course the shields expire after 4 seconds and you might not even get any value if you shield a unit not targeted. Shielding on Thresh is also better than HP on Syndra since Thresh has more Armor/MR. Also have to consider how often Thresh will cast."

I don't really understand this since it's not a cc ability and she can attack while it's enroute. Lissandra has a lock out while casting but she can't attack and it makes sense. Diana has an ability similar to Shen/Darius making a zone then damage in hut for a duration but she can gain mana the instant after casting but Shen cannot until both his zone expires and his 3 hits proc. Darius is also locked out until his timer expires. It just feels weird.\n\nFurther more the mana lock hurts some item uses like Shojin and Manazane. Manazane works best on either high mana abilities for an extra cast or low mana abilities without mana lock to get multiple casts out.

At 10, it was guaranteed game over, unless you hit it right in the turn you got knocked out and didn't get to cash out. 10 Heartsteel was giga giga broken, to the point that Fortune 7 doesn't even get close. And the thing is, it was as difficult to make as the RNG fortune one. You'd need to get level 9 and 3 spatulas. In double up, that was semi feasible, but even a good cash out could provide you with spatulas or time of traits.\nOnce you hit 10 Heartsteel, you'd get a X10 multiplier, it was insane.

Getting 2 emblems at 2-1 and 7 fortune before stage 4 is just as unreliable and difficult as getting 3 heartsteel emblems and hitting 10 heartsteel before stage 5. \n\nAnd yes it’s more technical because losing that streak hurts your game worse than previous econ traits, so if you play it right and you keep your streak and health up, you’re rewarded more than previous econ traits. It balances out. You just happen to remember the 1 game where the guy had the stars align ontop of getting early emblems and not the 99 other games where the fortune players got fucked over from holding hands/afk/didn’t hit the 2nd emblem they were focusing on hitting."

And for rng,e con trait that cashout after 1 win is extremely solved,you all in at 4-1 when ppl havent spiked much and just cheese a win for the cashout so now you cant reliably cashout on 4-1.

On first carousel, one guy took porcelain augement and another took warden augment. Despite this 3 OTHER people aslo decided to go into Ashe build. This is not a situation of one build being too good, as evidenced by their poor placement.\n\nI'm not trying to be overly combative here, but you're showing just one game where a bunch of goofballs held hands and all went bot 4 and  one guy highrolled with Warden+Porcelain Annie 3. This doesn't prove anything, and even if it did, the takeaway would be that if you force Ashe you're going to go bot 4 likely, which is the exact opposite point you're trying to make in the first place.\n\nIt's very easy to just parrot the negative comments that we see every day on forums and from streamers, but if we take a second and look at the data we can see there are a pretty decent number of builds that are viable right now. Just taking a quick look at MetaTFT, there's 8 builds right now abover average(4.5 placement) in Master+. We have 2 5-cost soup(counting as 1), dryad, heavenly kayne, etheral blades, umbral alune, bruiser kai'sa, duelist and Sages. Ironically the porcelain build you're complaining about is just under all of those.\n\nIf we instead look at top 4 rate, the ashe build ranks higher, but nowhere near the top of the list(again, data for Masters+). If you expand the data out to lower tiers, you'll notice that each time you go down a tier(emerald>plat etc) porcelain ashe along with other builds start to rank higher and higher. Bascially what we can infer from this is that they aren't necessarily the best build or we'd see them at the top in higher elo. They are just probably easier to play, and as such are often piloted more often by less skilled players.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I'm not going to ramble on any further. I guess I just think the meta is actually in a preety ok place. But that's just one guy's opinion."

Rn when playing Syndra you link Thresh + Ahri / Syndra later, and even in Aphelios who's in shambles rn you link Thresh + Syndra\n\nRemember that all fated units get the pairs individual bonus. Only the pair gets bonus hp. Pairing Thresh Ahri is incredibly good because all fateds can use AP well and the bonus resistances from Thresh with the shield he throws out is just a lot of tankiness too. Syndra is usually liked as a pair because it's another damage multiplier. She can't improve your Threshs shields like Ahri can but her damage buff is much better for Aphelios and Sett, so Syndra link is not good if you don't use them. There's a lot of nuances but basically you always keep Thresh linked and never link Aphelios"

At later stages with beefier frontline emblem link should objectively be better than yasuo link unless enemy team has backline access with high burst (something like xayah).

Unless you know exactly who you're playing against there's a chance your opponent prediction fails so better safe than sorry.\n\nWithout the emblem it's a bit harder to play because other people can grief you. With the emblem you can just buy a unit, slam the emblem if you're going to lose, if you win just don't slam it and this way you're able to keep a nice streak early on.\n\nIf by some reason your streak is ruined then your cash out is pretty much ruined as well. Your stack gains are reset so you just cash out whenever you can and try to play from that position, even if the best you can do is salvage a top 4.\n\nI never went for a crazy high cash out because there's a chance you lose a round while transitioning and go 8th. I generally go for a cash out around 95-130 stacks. There are way better cash outs for sure, but this loot tiers have been enough for me to turn the game around and win.

For example i trade an reasonable amount of hp to reach lv8 at 3.7 or 4.1 with 40 golds and roll but get only kaisa 1 and galio 1 so i not get what i want but i thin out the 4 costs pool so the guy with worse econ than me get 8 at 4-3 or after carousel but can roll ashe 2 and annie 2.

From what im guessing either some of these thing happened:\n\n+ You got griefed by some guy in the lobby, he intentionally sell his board to grief you. It is hard in this case if someone targeted you like that but I think it is best to scout around and try to sell your board too if you see someone do that\n\n+ You greed too much and burn too much hp, it is important to scout your next opponent and see if they are strong or weak, sometimes you need to bring your unit to front to die, sometime you need to put them in the back line and slam in generic items to kill unit to preserve some hp. It is also needed to put your carry like tristana or teemo to the side where your opponent put their trash tank so that you can kill those trash tank and save hp\n\n+ Dont go for raising the stake too much, my guess is that sometimes the fortune dice roll is not in your favor you need around 30 hp to pivot if you have fast hand and already know what to do. This mean that sometimes if you are at 45hp and with a 30 cashout dont go for raising the stake cause there is a high chance that it will roll higher than 3 and you will lose a lot of hp, in this case just take the 30 cash out and pivot. You need 30 hp and a fast hand to pivot cause im sure later on there will be 1 guy with 4 cost 3 stars that will steam rolled you so if you are at 10 hp your are pretty much dead.\n\nThese are my tips at emerald rank, im not high rank but i automatically play fortune if i get it at 2-1 2-2 2-3 or sometimes even later than that i still pivot into fortune if i feel like my board is a dead board and i need some boost from a 20-30 cashout."

She has a chance to have a sniper trait, so that is why he is toned down.\n\nWhile Annie does fine without any traits. Because she is Annie.\n\n  \nSo... for example, if dps characters are expected to do 100 damage per second, and one of them has a trait that makes her do 20% more damage when active, then you make her do 80 damage instead of 100 damage, so she won't be overpowered when the trait is active. So she performers similarly to others, but only with her trait active?\n\n  \nSo basically damage increase is a bait, because if damage can increase, the champ will be nerfed in the first place, so the damage increase won't do that much.\n\nLike you give a bonus to employees for good work, but make their base pay be total crap, so they need the bonus to be able to have a proper wage at all.\n\n  \nSo... that is balancing?",

There is also no default context in which a unit is played- a unit can be put on the board with almost any combination of traits/augments/items/other champs on your board and the opposing board. In terms of combat power balancing, TFT balancing is more about making sure no single variable has an outsized impact for its cost. Small stat nerfs and buffs to units that happen during patches are done in account of the compounding nature of these variables"

And how that is not probably the case, because they make glaring mistakes, and their code is often patched with bubblegum.

They also do full playtests of actual real gameplay with 8 players for 40~ minutes(can't do much of this because.... 40 minutes is a lot of the workday being used for near 0 return)\n\nThis has been repeatedly said and you need to actually research instead of making a thinly veiled hatepost about balance lmao."

They buffed porcelain and she still wasn’t played, they nerfed some of the other 5 costs and she started to be played a bit. But lissandra didn’t become “op” until Ashe got buffed. If lissandra had a 40% higher mana cost, she would probably be a bad unit, it’s all a numbers game.\n\nBard was the number 1 complaint people had in the first week. He had 0 changes from week 1 to 2 and his win rate and play rate dropped dramatically as people figured out what else was good in the set. This didn’t stop people like you (maybe not you specifically) from complaining endlessly that bard was way overturned and impossible to balance even though your “AI” would have kept bard exactly as he was."

GS doesn't do percent-health damage. GB doesn't actually break or reduce shields. Both of these items just make you do *more damage*. \n\nIt's not like anti-heal where building a Red Buff actually counters healing. If you're getting destroyed by a board with a lot of healing, the difference between anti-heal and no anti-heal is enormous. If you're getting destroyed by a board with a lot of health, or a lot of shields, building a GS/GB probably won't turn the tides (at least, not much more than any other damage item would)."

If you don't capitalize on how valuable armor is, your chances of beating high physical damage teams are disproportionately worse than they would be with any other stats or items you could be missing.\n\nSimilarly, as soon as your units are hitting shields often enough, Guardbreaker is listed alongside GS and Deathcap as one of the strongest raw DPS items in the game. If you aren't capitalizing on how powerful it is, you are leaving a disproportionately high amount of value on the table.\n\nWe're debating the semantics of it at this point, I think we both make a fair point."
    },
    {
      "comment_body": "Don't get me wrong: I love Guardbreaker and think it's a frequently underrated item. It just doesn't belong in the same category of unique counterplay as items that give anti-heal or sunder/shred. \n\nThere are situations in which, despite near-100% uptime on GB, a different damage item would still be more DPS. For example, maybe you're playing Snipers or Exalted units, so the power of damage amp as a stat is diluted compared to other vectors of scaling DPS (e.g. raw AD/AP, attack speed, mana, crit, etc.). \n\nWith, say, Last Whisper, there's no real substitute. If you're getting rocked by a tank stacked with resists, you're probably not going to find a damage item that can compensate for the lack of sunder by simply doing more damage. The same is true for anti-heal vs. healing comps.\n\nThis is why I say GB isn't really a counter to shields. It might be the *best* counter to shields in many situations, simply because it's the highest-DPS option for items, or because it kills components you wouldn't otherwise use. But if I grant that GB is a counter to shields, then I'd also argue *any* DPS item is a counter to shields.\n\nFor instance, Archangel makes you do more damage, often more damage than GB. Does that make AA a counter to shields? This is why I'm hesitant to call GS and GB \"counters\": It could give people the false impression that they're in the same category as anti-heal and sunder/shred items. In reality they're just good, often situational DPS items. \n\nI've definitely lost placements because I didn't build anti-heal, but I've never thought to myself, \"Man, if I had prioritized GB there, I would have won.\""

AFAIK this is the first set in which activating a second bracket doesn't accelerate the economic aspect of the trait at all. Also accidentaly winning sucks as hard as ever, so when you're griefed it's waaay too punishing, so i'ts way too risky to try and save hp. The dice roll can also mean that you inta 8th if you roll a 6 or 5, might as well just quit the game when a 2 or 3 would be fine, there is no previsibility like in heartsteel so you can't really plan ahead.\n\n  \nAnyway i'm just ranting cuz the eco traits are always my favorites and my entire reason to play the game, and this set i feel like it's essentially impossible to play them. I recall the devs saying they wanted to do it in a way that makes it playable even if you don't hit it on 2-1, and let me tell you man this is not it, this is not it at all. It's essentially impossible to get any decent cashout if you don't get it **exactely** at 2-1 (the loot tables are adjusted for the fortune increases from 2-1 specifically).\n\nAlso it feels like TFT has been gradually banning fun from the game, as this set specifically feels like a bunch generic stats stacking on top of each other, there's not a single good elusive emblem (last one was fortune), spatula variety has been outlawed, and the thing i miss the most are spatulas that really change the way a unit is played, as opposed to just giving it stats (heavenly, mythic, porcelain, etc). Man how i miss fireworks Daeja.  \n\nI dare not make any sugestion since i'm not a dev, designer, not even a good player lol (plat 1 currently), i just wanted to let you guys know, mercs were much better, it **felt** much better to play with, and that's saying a lot.",

Gnar is pretty weak unless built to carry. Illaoi actually has good trait diversity, but her health is surprisingly low for a 3 cost frontline. Shen has almost same health, is easier to 3 star, and has more armor and mr. Ammumu actually gets more survivability with just porcelain. Nautilus is, again, OK but not the best maintank as he will most likely ult once, and his ult gives no shield or health to survive longer. Sett is pretty weak without fated synergy.\n\n\nSome comps can get away with 4 wardens, normally also with porcelain and arcanists in the mix. Emblems would help tremendously to make this work.

Bruiser has a couple really nice augments honestly, and easy trait synergy with storyweaver. Warden is missing an augment to let them fight on their own. But with several emblems 6 warden 6 porcelain 2 arcanist, or 4 warden 4 porcelain 4 arcanist is possible. I can't think of another comp where 6 wardens would make sense. Or even 4 maybe. Maybe 4 warden 4 ghostly... idk.\n\n\nI agree with everything you said though."

And it doesn't have diminishing returns with armor/mr: 4 Warden 100 armor is 60% reduced damage while 4 behemoth 100 armor(155 total) is 61% reduced damage. As you go up to 200 armor 4 Warden mits about 73.3% vs behemoth's 71.8%\n\nBut tank traits in general aren't very stackable since they don't do damage.

Hero augs feel bad now because except for Shen and Kobuko all the ones with the specific hero augs suck ass even with the hero augs. I don't think more hero augs fix the fact that the 1-2 costs in this set just really fucking suck for the most part."

I dropped off tft a few months ago, and just came back randomly for set 11.\n\nAt first, I was excited to stack whatever and see what works. After quite a few games though, I realized something: All the current meta comps basically all have the same carries that have pretty much ability.\n\nThat ability is an attack that has projectiles seek someone to do damage, with making more projectiles, to do more dmg.\n\nLike last set there was twisted fate who threw out a bunch of cards and it was VERYYY satisfying to watch. Now each game everyone is building a knock off of that mechanic on a champ. \n\nNotable examples: Irelia, Ashe, Kaisa, Zoe, Syndra, essentially Alune, and the rest of the trickshot folks. It's different of it was just a mechanic between the trickshots, but right now it's basically a game of \"who can get their multiple projectiles unit to carry them the best\".\n\nLiterally most of the only comps I'm seeing are the ones above, and just seeing kaisa projectiles fly while I'm hoping my syndra projectiles get her. Zoe got her bounces going while I'm seeing another irelia with her blades pop off.  \n\nOh, plus half the champs in their skins look the same. By that, i mean their color palette, size, stature, and skin make it hard to see a difference. Sometimes i literally have no idea who im fighting at first glance. \n\nReksai looks like gnar, Soraka looks like Alune, Darius looks like yorick, malphite looks like chogath, Kayn looks like Yone, Caitlyn looks like aphelios, and so many other in between.\n\nI could just be crazy, but this all just feels so similar to each other.

Claw (bonus %Hp + healing and MR), redemption (%max HP healing + damage reduction). \nJust very hard to kill, gains a lot of HP and therefore damage, raid boss makes it even better\n\nAlso behemoth:\nJG(Damage), Archangel's (scaling damage), BT(if need survivability), Gunblade (if need damage/team healing) or Ionic spark (high MR lobby)\nLess survivability but tons of damage, more for fun than the other 2 but still okay, works awesome if lobby doesn't have much magic resist so you can get through the tanks quickly \n\nOf course don't take this as gospel, my experiences with it could very likely differ from yours or anyone else's, but this is what works for me."

Greeded a bit to get the spatula on him, keeping him itemless for the first couple of stages. Somehow remained somewhat healthy and hit 3\\* on 3-3/5. Shifted to levelling trying to hit 6 (dream for 8) Bruisers, and Azir offers me Dryad Crown as I was hiting my 1st emblem from a carousel spat at this point. Soft pivot to prioritise 6 dryad. At this point I'm already on 5 hp, so we're praying for top 4 (still 7 of us going). Fight after fight I overcome the odds offered by MetaTFT (was usually around 30% win prob, but I noticed it really isn't as reliable this set as it was last set.) and end up battling it out for first place in late stage 6. My opponent keeps repositioning but the bruisers won't buckle, in the end Kobuko always slaps down Lilia and Azir. We come to very last fight (I'm on 5, opponent on like 14), and as Kobuko slaps down Lilia and Azir I am overcome with joy at the dumbest win I ever got in this game. And as my joyous little yordle saunters over to the two defenseless Azir soldiers left on the now cold battlefield, a boom departs my opponent's tactician, and my screen goes gray.

Over the years he’s gotten more arrogant and oblivious to the state of the game. He acts like he’s Jesus Christ who died for the nonexistent Balance Team and QAs sins, and just refuses to ever make them take accountability, which leads to consistent B-Patches.

They must have data showing that these are fairly even in their expected win results, as they would just increase gold or something along those lines if it wasn't nearly in line. As well, augments are at least as swingy as primatic orbs. I know I've won games off single augments.\n\nI'm on your side though, I think they need to spice up the regular item rewards or remove them."

Since they haven't buffed it then it means the average placement must be about the same regardless. I'll say that there are many games where I'd much rather have 2 component anvils over an artifact or support item because the difference in having BIS vs an artifact on certain champs I'd huge. For example if you run Bard carry you **really** want BIS and the only artifact that has synergy with him is cursed Blade which is disabled."

You probably lose some synergies doing it, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Double Sett with an udyr missile on the corner has pulled out many wins for me where I otherwise stood no chance. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it's really your best shot.\n\nThe only other comp that would maybe be able to do it is a really strong reaper comp that can get access to the backline, but if you can't get the backline access or your carry gets focused down then it's gg.\n\nEdit: After a couple games with it, it seems Morgana is a pretty solid backline killer now after the most recent patch. If you can itemize a 2* Morgana that will give a pretty decent shot."

The comps main strength is Ashe ramping dmg w Lissandra CC while Annie is the best frontline unit atm if you manage to get at least 4 invokers. Lillia and Azir are there to enable Annie while they also deal huge amounts of magic dmg causing the comp to have great CC (Liss/Naut) great frontline (Annie) physical AND magic dmg (Ashe/Liss/Lillia/Azir).\n\nOption 1: Think of them as something similar to Kassadin/Veig/Senna where once they've scaled u can't win. Preventing the comp from going online by buying up important units (Annie/Lissandra/Ashe pref) or preventing them from getting important components for Rageblade/Shojin/Annie BIS tank items. You can also hold their other frontline units like Illaoi/Nautilus/Sett so that Liss/Ashe doesn't get enough time to CC/ramp since if it gets the whole board to 2\\* you simply don't win unless you have something relative to a  3\\* 4-cost lvls of power or above.\n\nOption 2 play backline access units like Udyr/Sett/Morgana/Alune/Hwei/Kai'sa or position a Lissandra to stun lock the Annie so your team can march right into their backline since wo Annie the comp has no frontline. \n\nThe Augments that ignore the first cc effect is good and Edge of Night/Qss are great into this comp since it counters Titans champions by CC'ing them and not letting them ramp."

Probably just need one of the three mana items, and then the other two items can be whatever AP carry items you can build. \n\nWhat i would say is that you probably want Umbral emblem, that takes the build from middling to very good. \n\nThe interesting thing is who else to prioritize, some sites have yorick/alune, some have yone/alune, some have alune/sylas. With emblem, you could also go kayn/yone or azir/alune as well. \n\nThe other build is Alune reroll with invokers, so a core of annie/alune/lillia/Azir.

If you can see you're going to lose the fight, add the emblem in and you'll end the round with 3 fortune and get loss credit. If you see you're going to win, just don't add the emblem and you won't mess up your loss streak.\n\nThis way you can field a stronger board to save hp without risking your loss streak."

Our tank items are also lowkey kind of WIS so even though illaoi is 3\\* she is dying too fast, I think we wasted a lot of money on 3\\*s instead of going 9 to spike our board even more so then we're stuck at 8 till like stage 6+\n\nso hypothetically speaking we spent 62g x 2g for each rr which most rr's average around 10 rr's OR MORE to hit so we spent at minimum 143 g to 3\\* all these 3\\* which could have gone into leveling, which I guess would be 125 if not rolling for 3\\* but since it's 80xp to go to 9 we would have had 45g left if we level from that amount which is a decent amount to find our 4 and 5 costs at 9 \n\nIF you really want to go the arcanist route probably would revolve around including amumu, lux, liss, you have + 1 porcelain so you can play around that\n\npersonally if i were to make some hybrid arcanist heavenly comp i would make the board  look like; syndra, illaoi, lux, liss 4 arcanist, soraka wukong + 2 hevanly spat + rakan diana for d lord, +amumu for warden with illaoi if can make it to 10 i'd switch to legendary D lord w azir/irelia duo carry"

  "self_text": "Hello! It's [Goody](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk_BRxbG4nQ6O7liQ4Da1KA) and I'm finally back with some fun comps to play!\n\nAll of these comps are based and centred around the 20 New Artefacts coming next patch! ([Here's the Full List](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1c5p5el/heres_the_20_new_artifacts_and_5_new_support/))\n\nThis is part of a collaboration I did with other TFT Creators called the Composition Competition. So big shout out to [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos), [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT) and [Nomsy Diff](https://www.youtube.com/@NomsyDiff/videos) for their contributions, **I think we really cooked with this one!** Please go show your support!\n\nIn total, there's around 30 comps I'll cover. Some of which **you'll have never seen before** but others are just slight variations of existing comps.\n\nThat is due to **some Artifacts not being unique enough to build entire comps around them**\n\nHowever, most Artifacts are **awesome!** And I can't wait to show you the comps around them!\n\nI will try include as much footage as possible in each section as well!\n\n---------\n\nTLDR;\n\nForbidden Idol -> Kench\n\nSilvermere Dawn -> Kha'zix/Wukong\n\nTalisman of Ascension -> Sylas\n\nCorrupt Vampiric Sceptre -> Gnar\n\nSeeker's Armguard -> Malphite/Sylas\n\nMittens -> Any Melee Carry (E: Lee Sin)\n\nRFC -> Qiyana\n\nProwler's Claw -> Kayn\n\nSpectral Cutlass -> Qiyana 3/Lee Sin\n\nLuden's Tempest -> Caitlyn\n\nSuspicious Trench Coat -> Ornn/Udyr\n\nInnervating Locket -> Any Tank (I like Yorick)\n\nHorizon Focus -> Lux/Nautilus\n\nLightshield Crest -> Thresh/Galio\n\nUnending Despair -> AP Kench?\n\nFishbones -> Ashe\n\nBlighting Jewel -> Teemo/Morgana\n\nCursed Blade -> Irelia\n\nLich Bane -> Teemo/Syndra\n\nWit's End -> Bard/Lux or Udyr/Liss\n\n---------\nAlso, due to delays, I haven't been able to make the video for this just yet but I'll update the post as soon as I can.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I tested these on the PBE and I have not played them in ranked. For transparency, here is my [lolchess](https://lolchess.gg/profile/euw/Goody-9999/set10)\n\n## There may have been changes during PBE to Live\n\nThere have been many patches during the PBE cycle, during which Riot may have removed an interaction. If anything didn't work, let me know! (It's difficult to test because the Artefacts aren't common)\n\nBut let's get started!\n\n--------\n\n# Inspiring Idol ([Forbidden Idol](https://imgur.com/BkWEVwx))\n\n\n----------\n\nAs a brief history lesson, I made a discovery about Forbidden Idol, Kench and the Inspiring Epitaph and I had a Kench 2 reach 80k HP [which I posted to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1c7c86z/80k_hp_kench_with_forbidden_idol/)\n\n([My VOD of this is here](https://youtu.be/wg0fXJws5ak?t=25221))\n\nAnd then /u/Perfect-Tangerine638 completely dwarfed this [by making his Kench hit 2.2 MILLION HP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1c7kh0v/i_see_your_80k_hp_tahm_kench_and_raise_you/) What a chad!\n\nSo what's going on here? How is Kench reaching such absurd HP numbers?\n\nWell that's because Kench's shield scales of his max HP and Forbidden Idol converts that shield into more max HP and so Kench will rapidly increase his max HP due to this loop. The only other unit that has a max HP shield is Ornn but **Kench's HP ratio is higher.**\n\nI'm not sure what Tangerine did to reach such an insane number but I can tell you what I did.\n\nI noticed that Forbidden Idol also worked on shields granted at the start of combat as well as from Augments\n\nA great example of this is Inspiring Epitaph.\n\nAny time a unit near Kench dies, Kench instantly gained 12.5% max HP and so he could start to snowball far faster.\n\n[However did you know that **Azir's soldiers also proc Inspiring Epitaph?**](https://youtu.be/arnE2frsF9I?t=8374)\n\nSo if you keep Azir summoning soldiers near Kench, Kench will snowball out of control as each of the soldiers perish and increase Kench's HP by 12.5% **each**!\n\nAn that's another reason why Ornn and Kench are the best users of Forbidden Idol, as they both can easily field Azir and Invokers.\n\n## [And so this is what your Inspiring Idol board would look like](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCzBvWxXtDhYnZaFwa)\n\nWhere you can give the Idol to Kench or Ornn and you have 4 Invoker active to keep Azir casting.\n\nIn my opinion, Kench 2 is stronger than Ornn 2 with Idol as Kench has higher HP ratios on his shield, he has HP multipliers through Mythic and Bruiser and you can hit Kench far sooner than Ornn.\n\nJust be wary of Lissandra because even a 80k HP Kench will lose to Liss (i got 3rd) due to her insane CC that will displace Kench and stop him from casting.\n\n-------------\n\n# AD Thresh ([Silvermere Dawn](https://imgur.com/jQsWfX9), [Talisman of Ascension](https://imgur.com/j7Cz47h), [Corrupt Vampiric Sceptre](https://imgur.com/a/VulFP4L))\n\n---------\n\nThis idea was invented by [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT) and tweaked by me.\n\n## [AD Thresh board](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCyAwXcDiR4YfZQG)\n\n### [ [VOD] AD Thresh in action](https://youtu.be/LzThrKMCjI0?t=13773)\n\nNow the reason why AD Thresh is possible is due to his insanely high base AD ([Thresh almost has the highest](https://imgur.com/nm6Cf9v)) and 3 of the incoming new Artefacts\n\nSpecifically, there's [Silvermere Dawn](https://imgur.com/jQsWfX9), [Talisman of Ascension](https://imgur.com/j7Cz47h), and [Corrupt Vampiric Sceptre](https://imgur.com/a/VulFP4L).\n\nSilvermere Dawn will give Thresh a huge amount of AD, Armour and MR whilst also not debuffing Thresh that much since his base Attack Speed is 0.5 anyway.\n\nBut there's also Corrupt Vampiric Sceptre that will get rid of that *annoying ability* and keep Thresh autoing and sustained.\n\nAnd Talisman is generally the most reliable choice since Thresh is 2 range and so can sit behind your tanks and stall those 18 seconds, after which he'll just clean up.\n\nSo AD Thresh is incredibly flexible due to what items he can take but also due to Fated.\n\nYou can select whichever Fated Bonus to make up for what Thresh is lacking.\n\nFor example, you can link Syndra and Sett is Thresh is lacking Omnivamp and a Damage Amplifier. Or Aphelios and Thresh if he's lacking AD and Tankiness and so on.\n\nJust bear in mind that Thresh can auto as little as once every 2 seconds, so you need him to hit as hard as possible. So I love items like Infinity Edge and Last Whisper but you also can't go wrong with DB. Just make sure you have reliable Sunder as Aphelios may not be enough.\n\nAdmittedly, while I have loved playing this comp (I even played it during Mortdog's Artifact Tournament), I have struggled due to how contested Thresh can be.\n\nAnd while Thresh is a really fun user of these Artefacts, there are better (more meta) users of them\n\n-----------\n## [Corrupt Vampiric Sceptre Gnar board](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCQArOfWOXwYNZWaKb)\n\nCVS is insane on Gnar as Gnar's **passive will continue to stack**, which will then get further increased by CVS and in turn, give Gnar a ton of healing.\n\nSo this board isn't anything new but Gnar's itemisation will. Ideally you want to give Gnar **Double Titan's + CVS** so he can get as much AD as possible, deal as much damage as possible, and heal for as much as possible.\n\nWith Dryad, Warden and Double Titan's, Gnar will be considerably tanky and dish out a ton of damage.\n\n## Talisman of Ascension Sylas/Riven\n\n### [Riven Comp Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/1capphm/patch_148b_vietnamese_bruiser_riven_reroll_guide/)\n\n### ([Play a similar board for Sylas](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCaAUVzBxWKXpYNZha))\n\nRiven and Sylas are probably the best users of Talisman for a few reasons. Firstly, vertical Bruiser is a ton of HP to get through which will stall for enough time especially since Riven and Sylas innately have healing in their abilities.\n\nBut if you're worried about the holder dying in combat, you can just trap then in a corner with ranged carries. And it doesn't matter if you're entire board is dead as your last unit will easily be able to wipe the enemy board with double the HP and a massive damage boost (except against Lissandra)\n\nBut there's also a bug with this Artifact where Bruisers can double dip into the HP gain.\n\n[Have a look at these images of Sylas](https://imgur.com/a/5X383PT)\n([VOD HERE](https://youtu.be/fe3Hwufohio?t=13890))\n\nBefore combat he has 5k HP but once Ascension procs, he shoots all the way up to 14k HP.\n\nWhat's happening here is that Bruiser gives Sylas all the HP before combat, but then during combat Bruiser is also affecting Talisman's bonus HP and increasing it by an additional 80%. (5x2.8 =14)\n\nSo due to this bug, Bruisers are disproportionately broken with Talisman thus you should always give it to them.\n\n--------\n\n# Heavenly Dawn (Heavenly + Silvermere Dawn)\n\n\n---------\n\nBut let's get back to the fun stuff! Here's Heavenly Dawn from [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT)\n\n## [Heavenly Dawn Board](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCeVGPTQSX3RgEJZ6T)\n(Enable whoever your carry is)\n\n[As Alan mentions here](https://imgur.com/3R6bJy4), [Silvermere Dawn](https://imgur.com/jQsWfX9) is best on AD casters who have powerful ults and can use the tank stats well like Sett or Wukong.\n\nHowever, Wukong is the better choice here as he can easily heal for his insane damage through Sage and due to Kha'zix and Malphite also being great users of the item.\n\n([Here's Silvermere Dawn Wukong in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxC2_rIPLeE))\n\nLike Wukong, Kha'zix is an AD caster but Kha'zix jumps about and one shots whatever he ults. And the tank stats are great for Kha'zix as it makes up for his squishyness.\n\n([Silvermere Kha'zix in action](https://youtu.be/i1K2CyMzWdo?t=339))\n\nAlternatively, you also have Malphite. He doesn't use the AD well but he is the most effective with the CC as any units hit but Malphite's ult cone, will also get stunned.\n\nUnfortunately, Malphite and Kha'zix can fall off late game mostly due to them being 1 cost units.\n\nBut, the next Artefact stops Malphite from falling off and that's Seeker's Armguard\n\n-------------\n\n# MalFIGHT (Malphite Reroll + [Seeker's Armguard](https://imgur.com/a/NNgtaKt))\n\n--------\n\nI gotta give full credit to [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos) for this one. This comp is so insanely fun to watch just because of how hard Malphite can clap.\n\n[(Seeker's Malphite Footage Here!)](https://youtu.be/bDKQGLIWPHU?t=59)\n\n[And as Rapid says here](https://imgur.com/hbQyQso), since Malphite’s auto are AOE, he gets takedown credit incredibly easily and so he can snowball very quickly as he converts both the bonus Armour and AP into more damage.\n\nBut even though his base AS is pretty low, you still want to give him Rageblade so his can auto more during his ult duration.\n\nSo Malphite's main items are Rageblade + Seeker's then you can give him whatever you want.\n\nYou can't go wrong with more omnivamp (Like BT), but what could be hilarous is Jewelled Gauntlet.\n\nSo your comp will look something like this\n\n## [Seeker's Malphite Reroll](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCgAwV6PuCJXSYiZWa)\n\nBear in mind that both Heavenly and Behemoth are incredibly flexible and so this board can wildly vary. So just play around what you get.\n\nBut Malphite does love the AP from Soraka, the HP from Neeko, the Attack Speed from Wukong and the omnivamp if you get a spatula.\n\nAnd if Malphite has crit, then you can play Kha'zix to increase his crit chance.\n\nGhostly is also nice here to stop Malphite getting stuck on mega tanks and Sage will give him more sustain.\n\nYour level 9 can be Rakan, Lissandra, Udyr or Azir.\n\nBut Malphite is not the only great user of Seeker's\n\n----\n\n# Mageseeker Sylas\n\n-----\n\nNow, I'm sure many of you have already thought about Sylas being the best user of Seekers due to him being a Melee AP Bruiser carry who can use all of these stats well.\n\nSo let me add a bit of extra flavour here by **combining Seeker's with Ionic Spark**\n\n## [Here's the board I play](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCxV.BcvWaChX4YtEYZwa)\n\nThis combination is phenomenal for Sylas as he can dash toward the enemy backline so they're in range of his Spark and so proc the damage on frontliners as well as backliners.\n\nNow this is amazing as Sylas will now scale incredibly quickly with Seeker's as he will gain the takedown credit for any unit that Ionic Spark procc'ed on. And so this combo makes up for Sylas' single target weakness and let's him turbo scale\n\nEventually, Sylas will have so many stacks that backline carries and Mages just can't do anything to him and Sylas will just one shot them. Hence Mageseeker Sylas (is this lore accurate?)\n\nNow ideally, you combine Sylas with Alune as her backline damage is great and can execute especially if she has anti-heal (Morello/Red Buff).\n\nBut Seeker's plus Ionic isn't exclusive to Sylas, and you can give these items to another melee AP carry or even a tank.\n\nSeeker's is incredibly flexible like the next Artefact.\n\n-----\n# [Mittens](https://imgur.com/nLK95bR)\n\nNow this Artefact is perhaps the most flexible out of the new and existing Artefacts, as any unit in the game can use Attack Speed, Damage Reduction and movement speed well.\n\nBut it will be better on melee carries as they tend to be a tad squishy.\n\n----------- \nEdit 1: Thanks to /u/ContaneShoko for the insight\n\nMittens is really good on Lee Sin as he uses the Attack Speed well with both of his traits\n\nWith Mittens, Lee Sin refuses to die while also slapping everyone and everything.\n\nLee is so absurdly tanky and the immunity to Chill is huge to keep his damage up\n\n\n----------\n\nHowever, those stats don't really matter. The only thing I care about is the reduced unit size\n\n[I mean just look at how small this Teemo is with Trench Coat and Tiny but Deadly](https://imgur.com/a/caEzXBV)\n\n[[Full video Here!](https://youtu.be/xPO27Wowisk?t=88))\n\nIT'S SO CUTE\n\nSo here's my request to you guys\n\nPlease please please show me screenshots of you stacking Mittens, Mittens + Trench Coat, or Mittens + Tiny But Deadly.\n\nCan it get any smaller and cuter?\n\n-----\n\n# [RFC](https://imgur.com/a/9qKAOoW) Qiyana\n\n----\n\nBut let's talk about something that isn't small, which is the range you can gain from the return of RFC.\n\nNow what's interesting about this Artifact is that not many abilities scale with range. In fact, some units like Kayn and Wukong actually have negative range scaling as their damage is dealt in a 1 hex radius around the unit themselves and not the target.\n\nSo you want to give RFC to units that aren't impeded by range, the best of which is Qiyana.\n\n[[VOD] Footage here](https://youtu.be/arnE2frsF9I?t=3518)\n\nRegardless of range, Qiyana's ult will always hit her primary target and any units 2 hexes behind her target.\n\nAnd Qiyana will try to reposition to hit as many units as possible with her ult which allows her to farm that extra range very quickly.\n\n## [I covered Qiyana Reroll in depth in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQIpFMzjhM)\n\nBut here's the comp [you play around Heavenly](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCsVGWeX6RgE3SJZTT.CTRSa.BhJ) and here's the [comp you play around Duelist](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCsVGPeX6RjEMZ1FTT.CRhDka).\n\n(The Heavenly version is stronger imo)\n\nBut generally, RFC is best on units like Qiyana who have secondary damage that can farm range and not on units like Kayn who have terrible range scaling.\n\nBut the opposite of this is true for the next Artifact\n\n--------\n\n# [Prowler's Claw](https://imgur.com/a/Tp6aeDY) Kayn\n\n-------\n\nThe big issue and limitation with Prowler's Claw is that the holder can still take aggro from enemy carries. So if the holder doesn't have enough tankiness or sustain, then they can just get obliterated and do nothing.\n\nThe holder of this item needs to be able to tank damage, have incredible sustain, while also being able to get away with building survivability items.\n\nMost AD carries, like Qiyana, can't do this, but of course, Kayn can!\n\nKayn gets loads of damage from Reaper and his transformation. So with HoJ, BT and Prowler's on Kayn, he meets all the conditions perfectly.\n[[VOD] Footage here](https://youtu.be/eT9TwdipBRI?t=11600)\nAnd Prowler's will allow Kayn to cleanse any anti heal on him.\n\nFrom what I've played no one felt nearly as good as Kayn but I think an OK secondary option is Lee Sin as he's kinda similar to Kayn in terms of tankiness but Lee won't be dealing nearly as much damage.\n\nSo out of all the AD carries, I just think this item is specifically amazing on Kayn.\n\nBut there is an Artefact that most AD melee carries will love which is Spectral Cutlass\n\n---------\n\n# [Spectral Cutlass](https://imgur.com/a/trioHYl) Duelists\n\n------------\n\nThis item gives AD stats, so it'll best on an AD carry and since the holder needs to be able to sustain damage from the enemy carry, it's best on an AD melee carry.\n\nWith this item, you can snipe the enemy carry before they get the chance to do anything\n\nNow Kayn can waste the 6 seconds as he needs to transform so this item is ideal for those who can quickly cast their abilities like Lee Sin and Qiyana\n([VOD of this here](https://youtu.be/LQ7bTxuxu-U?t=27761))\nAnd what's great with Lee and Qiyana is that they scale quickly with Duelist and their abilties can multiple units and once, and so you can nuke the backline within those 6 seconds.\n\nSo you should place your Spectral holder in your centremost rearmost hex so they can target left or right and hit as many enemy carries as possible.\n\nBut as this point, I'm sick of AD Artefacts, so let's move on to an AP one!\n\n-----------\n\n# Heavenly Caitlyn ([Luden's Tempest](https://imgur.com/a/R1Gi9ng))\n\n------------\n\nNow Caitlyn loves this item as she tends to overkill a lot\n\nAnd the Luden’s damage can proc Luden’s again if they overkill which is common since the Ghostly Spectres transfer before the Luden’s damage will hit\n\nSo of course, any Caitlynn Reroll comp is great but here's also a new variant from [Nomsy Diff](https://www.youtube.com/@NomsyDiff/videos) which is\n\n##  [Heavenly Caitlyn](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCoA2IGPSWWYJZgFTTBG)\n\nThrough Heavenly, you give Caitlyn as many raw stats as possible so her first ult completely nukes, procs Luden's and proceeds to wipe the board\n\nBut is there another Luden's user?\n\n-------\n\n# Lucky Luden's (Luden's Tempest)\n\n---------\n\nThis was shown to me by [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos) and I mean [just watch this clip](https://gyazo.com/b1c529200b610c2b5c90e0d0e91b869e).\n\n[[More Footage Here](https://youtu.be/zvrl6VqdCSw?t=115)]\n\nKobuko just completely nukes the entire board with a single cast because he has scaled so much and how much damage amp he has. And the subsequent Luden's procs are just mental.\n\nNow a lot of the power here is behind those Talismans of Ascension that Kobuko has.\n\nSo how do we even mimic a fraction of this power?\n\nWell we need a Talisman for ourselves or Kobuko's Lucky Paws Hero Augment. Either of these give Kobuko a insane damage boost with Ludens\n\nBut one of these conditions must be met for this to work but ideally you have both :)\n\nAnyway, Luden's is great for Kobuko as that is the only damage item you need on him as Kobuko's damage scales with max HP. Kobuko gains more HP through his passive and you can play more Bruisers to increase his damage, which means that your item options on Kobuko are extremely flexible.\n\nI'd recommend tank or sustain items but again, you have a lot of options.\n\nAnd Lucky Luden's Kobuko makes me curious how Ethereal Blades Shen would perform with this Artefact.\n\nBut I will say that the setup for Kobuko is far more difficult than Caitlyn's, so if you want a safe Luden's user, then go for Cait.\n\n-----------\n\n# Luden's Kha'Zix/Kog'Maw \n\n-----------\n\nFull credit to /u/Raytiger3\n\n> Luden's Echo Kha'Zix is pretty insane (and to a lesser extent Kog'maw too).\n\n> 3* Kha'Zix often overkills by ~500 because he always targets lowest hp enemy. In some combats, every 40 mana you deal 2000 dmg from Luden's.\n\n> Only issue is that this entire strat is pretty reliant on highrolling. You need 3* Kha and you need either a good damage or omnivamp augment. Plus, Deathblade and/or IE is pretty essential since you want to maximize cast dmg.\n\n------------\n\n# Piñata Party ([Suspicious Trench Coat](https://imgur.com/a/PO7IkLN))\n\n-----------\n\nHere's another one from [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT)\n\nWith Trench Coat, the effects of the holder's items can proc again on the clones. And that includes the effect of the new Support item [Unstable Treasure Chest](https://imgur.com/a/r5cCmAN).\n\n[Even just 1 Trench Coat and 1 Treasure Chest will result in 9 bonus items for your team, which is insane!](https://imgur.com/a/brhp68f)\n\nBut what if you don't get Treasure Chest?\n\nWell, you can also Trench Coat Ornn so each of the little Ornns can ult and farm items for your team.\n\nAnd there's also other crazy combinations where you combine Trench Coat with Diamond Hands.\n\n([VOD OF THIS HERE](https://youtu.be/yD7Gg0typjo?t=13276))\n\nDiamond Hands will proc on the initial unit and then proc each time on each of the clones. So per combat, you can proc it up to 4 times!\n\n------------\n\n# Trench Coat Teemo (Suspicious Trench Coat)\n\n-----------\n\nBut are there any carries that can use Trench Coat well?\n\nWell, [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT) also came up with [Trench Coat Teemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPO27Wowisk)\n\n[As Alan mentions here](https://imgur.com/mF6YYoN), each unique Teemo can stack their DOT on the same unit.\n\nBut this is risky because Teemo needs to be in range of damage so he can proc Trench Coat.\n\nSo you can give Teemo Edge of Night as each of the clones will be able to proc the item as well.\n\nThis is similar to Udyr who has in built aggro shed through Spirit Walker, that each of this clones will also benefit from.\n\nSo your safest bet for a Trench Coat carry will likely be Udyr.\n\nAlan also cooked up [Tattoo of Force, Trench Coat and Horizon Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8_MlfH1xFM) on this Rek'sai which just perma knocked up everything and dealt a ton of damage.\n\nHowever, this combination will be incredibly rare\n\n**! But be careful, the Coat Clones can drop items if they're ulted by Lissandra. !**\n\n\n----------\n\n# [Innervating Locket](https://imgur.com/a/lTK2aCs) Yorick\n\n---------\n\nNext up, we have Innervating Locket which is huge for any tank that have ults that increase their tankiness, particularly if they increase their max HP.\n\n**For example, Diana, Ornn, Garen with his Hero Augment or Yorick with or without his.**\n\nMy favourite is easily Yorick because he can scale so rapidly with the Locket mana generation. Amumu is also a great option as he'll just keep casting, healing and getting damage reduction from Porcelain.\n\nBut the next Artefact is a tank's worst nightmare\n\n--------\n\n# [Horizon Focus](https://imgur.com/a/CbMQC5J) Lux/Naut\n\nThis Artefact is super scary for any unit as now the holder's CC will now deal a ton of damage alongside it\n\nSo the 2 units with the most CC output are Lux and Nautilus, both of which you play on\n\n## [4 Porcelain 4 Warden](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCoAfWRC2QvX4YyEbZcG)\n\nLux is your safe backline option but Nautilus is your option if you want him to nuke the enemy backline as soon as possible.\n\nSo you can give Horizon Focus to Lux until you find Naut 2\n\nAnd what's insane with this item is that the damage from it can crit with the Jewelled Lotus Augment (but not Jewelled Gauntlet)\n([Footage of this Here](https://youtu.be/yD7Gg0typjo?t=8638))\nAnd if you combine this Artefact with Silvermere Dawn, then you'll proc the effect of Horizon **on every auto!**\n\nHowever, this Artifact is hard countered by CC immunity because the holder can't stun whoever is CC immune and so can't proc the effect of Horizon Focus\n\n-------\n\n# [Lightshield Crest](https://imgur.com/a/8MlP1I2) Thresh/Galio\n\nNow this item is similar to Innervating Locket where it's just generally good on a tank but I think Lightshield is better for your secondary tank as you get a lot of value when the holder dies.\n\nSo Thresh is likely the best user as he gains resistances from Fated and Behemoth and his ult also provides shields alongside resistances. So Lightshield Thresh makes your board considerably more tanky.\n\nAlternatively, Galio can give big shields during his ult as he gains Armour and MR based on his current Armour and MR. And if he dies during his ult, then that's a massive shield for your board.\n\n--------\n\n# AP Kench ([Unending Despair](https://imgur.com/a/buCJphs))\n\n--------\n\nOK so I'm not going to lie, this Artefact is probably the least interesting out of the bunch, and I wouldn't really recommend you take it over the other ones.\n\nThis Artifact should be better in conjunction with other Artefacts like Forbidden Idol but it's rare for you to get multiple Artifacts in a single game\n\nHowever having said that, I do think there is potential with units that love Idol like Kench and Ornn.\n\n[Especially if you play AP Kench which was posted to Twitter by Tex Summers](https://twitter.com/tex_summers/status/1784670290238493092)\n\nKench should get massive shields on this board and so should maximise the value from Despair. If this board doesn't use it well, i don't know what else can.\n\n# [Fishbones](https://imgur.com/a/QA0x0fI) Snipers/Tristana/Malphite/Azir\n\nSo of course with Fishbones, Snipers will love this item as they'll use the extra range extremely well and deal more damage with it, particularly if you give them Fishbones alongside Runaan's or Red Buff.\n\n### (Fishbones Ashe is very flexible)\n\nBut let's talk about something more fun and that's Fishbones Tristana.\n\nWith Fishbones, Tristana can cross map ult and nuke backlines. This is especially hilarious with her buff in 14.9 and IE + DB. However it is inconsistent because there tend to be more frontliners than backliners\n\n([Fishbones Tristana VOD Here](https://youtu.be/fe3Hwufohio?t=10143))\n\nAnd funnily enough, [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos) showed [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDKQGLIWPHU) that Fishbones Malphite isn't that bad either because he won't get stuck on a single unit and can deal loads of damage all over the place.\n\nLastly, Fishbones isn't that bad on Azir because he'll spawn the dummy where he ults, which could just be near the enemy backlines. So Azir's soldiers can find themselves in interesting places.\n\n------\n\n# Foamy Teemo ([Blighting Jewel](https://imgur.com/a/mgz7WzQ))\n\n-------\n\nNow Blighting Jewel is a very narrow Artefact wherein only Teemo and Morgana use it well and that's it.\n\nThe MR reduction applies per tick of their DOT abilities so they reduce MR rapidly and start generation mana very quickly.\n\nI've tried this item on other AP carries like Alune, but it never performed as well as Teemo/Morgana\n\nSo you should just aim to play around them with this Artefact.\n\n## [Bruiser Kai'sa For Teemo](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCLANVqBUW7CpX8DxY5Z)\n\n([Here's footage of Foamy Teemo from Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Puok6VFNZSw))\n\n## And I like [Sage Sylas for Morgana](https://tactics.tools/team-builder/QCZA3OUVuBeW8CpX6RxYNZ)\n\n--------\n\n# [Cursed Blade](https://imgur.com/a/d4IuXMx)\n\n-------\n\nNow last time I checked, this item was godlike on Irelia and subpar on everyone else but that may have changed with one of the numerous patches since.\n\nFor most units, 13 stacks is pretty hard to get. And with the effects of this item being hard countered by Edge of Night, I honestly don't think this item is that great.\n\n----------\n\n# Lich Bane\n\n--------\n\nNothing special here, just goes on units that like Blue Buff and Nashors like Teemo and Syndra\n\n-------\n\n# [Wit's End](https://imgur.com/a/qOE6Z6J)\n\n-------\n\nLastly, we have Wit's End\n\nI generally think that you put Wits on a backline carry with a lot of attack speed like Lux or Bard and you give them Rageblade. Or you put this item on a melee AP carry with high base Attack speed like Lissandra or Udyr as they'll use the resistances from the item well.\n\nBut luckily [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos) is here to save the day with [Rageblade Rageblade Wit's End Malphite](https://gyazo.com/1cb05f9da7ff601a207eac33f54b1789) which hits really hard and heals for a ton. If you want to try something unique, definitely try that out!\n\n--------\n\n# Fin.\n\n--------\n\nOk that was extremely long but I think that's everything?\n\nI may add more as I play more but I'm very exhausted so bear with me :)\n\nAgain, huge shoutout to [Rapid](https://www.youtube.com/@RapidTFT/videos), [Alan](https://www.youtube.com/@Alan-TFT) and [Nomsy Diff](https://www.youtube.com/@NomsyDiff/videos) for participating in the Composition Competition!\n\nPlease let us know which of these comps are your favourite!\n\nAnd if there's anything I missed, any questions you have or any silly typos, let me know! I'll address them as soon as possible\n\nThese Artefacts are very fun and I hope you guys enjoy playing with them!\n\nThank you for reading <3",

For example in this team comp, Sylas is a great thiefs gloves user because he can use ap items and tank items well, while also using certain ad items like bloodthirster okay. Thresh only uses tank items well and if he's get anything else he isn't using it effectively.  Thresh is also able to use crown guard if you had the ability to swap items"

  "self_text": "This is my 3rd TFT Review update for this set as a returning player (see [TFT Review 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1cfcnbf/tft_review_2/)). \n\nI will add to this review that after learning more about what the units did and the comps, that I started to have more fun while trying out a bunch of different things; this allowed me to play dozens more games.\n\nMy favorite strategy while playing casually is the econ strategies, which this set does have a lot of. I tried out a bunch of things, but I still didn't try everything, which shows that this set does have replay potential. \n\nThe biggest reason why I wouldn't want to play anymore is that although I can play a bunch of different things, a lot of times it ends up bleeding out into a 3rd place from a long lose streak. This makes it feel as though  I played and understand most of the viable comps already, and that there isn't that much to see anymore, and also that the bleeding 3rd place comp didn't do much and that I could have ffd at any moment since there wasn't anything I could do to prevent losing to 5+ units. And this is while playing casually and lightheartedly to try something different or interesting.\n\nIt's also actually difficult to be able to play degen strategies since they require perfect circumstances to even get them. An example would be how I started a game with Riven 2 and win streaked with Storyweavers, got Storyweaver augment, and then got TWO spatulas from wolves to level with my health and gold lead to level 10 for 10 Storyweaver. That's basically the only time where I had something truly insane, and even then it didn't satisfy me that much.\n\nIn conclusion, this set fun is fun to play casually, although it becomes less playable with familiarity and lack of ability to hit truly insane things thanks to lower standard deviation rng overall (as far as how much players highroll or lowroll from the norm).

The same can be said for the shield, def, and mr items as well.\n\nBanshees also save ur a QSS slot as well.\n\nIf u have 3 speed items stacks, the affected champs are looking at around 75-90 atk speed, now imagine a carry getting that boost with 3 empty slot for items.

It's the same reason why I don't like things like loot subscription or champion conference. They randomly give you an advantage, and sometimes your opponent will get a key component to their comp, and you will get an extra 4 or 5 gold. I have had many trainer games where none of my extra traits go together, like arcanist, umbral, and sniper, while my opponent could get porcelain heavenly dragonlord or something. Not to mention fortune at all.\n\nAs for things like the regular spat, everyone just goes the same comps, even more than usual.

Second place guy ended up using exactly none of his sentinel traits (warden, dragonlord, and umbral), but managed to do really well because he played the comp no one else went for (no one rolled porcelain and there were LOTS of dragonlord emblems). So while there are obviously still high-rolls and low-rolls with the trainer sentinel, (my win, case in point), I still think it adds quite a bit of variance to the game, regardless of what you roll and if you choose to play what you roll (for example, no one hit ghostly and only 1 guy hit reaper, which meant kayn was mostly left unpicked). And I'm definitely not high rank, so it might be a bit different in higher elos, but the vast majority of players are casuals and closer to my rank than to grandmaster."

The base game is already pretty complex and has plenty of variance from augments, shops, openers, fight rng, etc.\n\nInviting more just means you have less control over your games. Increasing variance & being in a more disadvantageous spot to no fault of your own doesn’t equate to more skill expression just because you HAVE to play better to place top 4 than otherwise.\n\nYou don’t think it’s a skill issue when you roll 60g on 8 and hit no upgrades but someone else hits 3 2\\* 4 costs with 30g do you? You play optimally and flexibly to reduce the influence of luck on your games, but you won’t ever out-place a luckier player unless they’re significantly worse than you.\n\nAlso, why would any competitive player invite spatulas or emblems in their games when dryad, heavenly, porcelain & fortune emblems are statistically way better than all other emblems?\n\nNot saying there are no scenarios where encounters & portals invite more skill expression, but it's rare especially when things like emblems don't perform evenly."

And like i said its not just items - it can be the exact 4 cost his comp needs on 2-7 while you only got 8 gold worth of trash. It can be him getting a radiant item while you got a tome in a comp that doesn't use tome well, and then you missed on what you could use. It can be way more than just items brother.\n\nIn an even skilled lobby, when you lowroll you still go 8th unless someone else lowrolled worse than you. In the overall sense of the 200 games you play yeah this one game doesn't matter - but the question is why do people dislike those portals not whatever the fuck you're on about."

Even though they played their game exactly the same way as anyone in the lobby would have.\n\nI think the lobbies are fun, and by no means should they get rid of them, but unbeatable boards are just that.

I guess OP wanted to keep her in to give Aatrox bruiser, but that is the other part: Do we really still want to play (and 3*) an Aatrox with 0 items? It is in the cookiecutter version of this comp, but whenever you get an Emblem and that doesn't help you hit the next breakpoint you should consider alternative routes.\n\nIn this case I'd be interested in Morgana+X over Aatrox/Rek'Sai to keep Ghostly-4 in. \n\nI'd even be tempted to skip going for 3* altogether since levelling to find Azir becomes so much more tempting with the emblem. Maybe roll until you hit one of them and then start pushing level? Obviously becomes a lot more specific to the exact spot at that point."

Literally any player that has played the game a decent amount can look at this screenshot and see several reasons why op lost lol. Like, picking combat augments isn't exactly difficult/heavily reliant on rng lol, there are plenty of them to be offered. And isn't it just kind of common sense that you need combat power when your board is full of 2 cost units facing against 4 and 5 costs lmao (also dude just look at their items and think about how much better they could be if they made good items lol, they could have lw gargoyles deathcap instead of JG titans spark for example)\n\n\n\n\nBesides, it's not like I see myself as some kind of theory crafting god telling op that gnar is fine because I got first with it once lol, I literally saw it being played with success in the tournament this weekend.

Lee is not a very durable unit, even at three star. The guy that went second had straight combat augments, while the Lee player had nothing of that short. Additionally between Lissandra, Annie, Nautilus and possibly Lux all having stuns in their kit, Lee probably got pain trained. Outside of those, Lissandra is too good right now and Lee doesn't have enough AoE to effectively clean out the enemy board, it is very possible that the Liss player cooked Lee's team and Lissandra one shot him when he was left alone. The meta is not in the best possible spot nowadays, but I genuinly think that even in a \"perfect\" meta there is a good chance this would have still happened."

I have no idea how so many people seem to semi-consistently hit 7/7. Even when I hit an emblem either from augments or the 30 luck payout, there's no chance I'll be anywhere near hitting the other option as well. Do you not need to get insanely lucky to hit both of these rare and absurdly specific RNG requirements in the same game?\n\nAm I supposed to just... keep stacking luck until I'm as close to 1 HP as possible, and then cash out, hoping for the best? Doesn't seem to land me more than 60-80 luck, most of the time, so it's not like I'd get any Fortune emblems from it, which in turn would keep me from ever reaching 7 Fortune.\n\nFrom what I can tell, you have 3 options to get Fortune emblems from Fortune payouts: 30-39 luck has a 40% chance of a Tome of Traits. 95-129 luck has a 25% chance of giving +1 to all traits. And 250+ luck has a 50% chance to give a \"mystery gift\", which in turn *can* contain Fortune emblems. Realistically, to get 7/7 Fortune, you need to get a Fortune emblem from an Augment (Fortune, Wandering Trainer, or Pandora's - two of which require an additional layer of luck to actually give Fortune), from a portal (trainer sentinel, tome of traits - both of which require extra luck), or from the 30-39 luck payout (which has a 40% chance to give you *even a chance* of an emblem) - and you need to hit two out of three of these to get your required two emblems. And that doesn't even begin to consider the fact that you need to be already losing if you want to build your luck streak, so even if you do hit both your emblems, you might not even have enough player health left to actually benefit from it; you don't get any immediate combat benefits."

It'll be stronger than most support items in stage 2, but by late game it'll be a lot worse. I think it's an interesting early game addition to an item class that is known for late game power.\n\nI think you're underestimating the strength of support items, especially late game. If you think about it, giving 3 random items is pretty similar if not worse than a lot of the other support items, many of which can give bonus stats to units that already have 3 items, which is inherently stronger than giving a single item to a unit without any other items.\n\nBy the end of the game items like radiant virtue, aegis of the legion, and randuin's omen are giving their stats to 7+ units. that's much stronger than giving 3 items to random units, especially since the units don't get the items at the start of the fight, meaning that (especially if they're tank items) you're not getting 100% value out of the items."

There's a support item that gives a mini gargoyle + shield to 5 allies, easier to position. \n\nPlus, support items can act like a \"fourth item\" to giga carries. Kayn with 3 damage/healing items, plus cc immunity and more attack speed from that one support item, is kinda like Kayn with 4 items. And since items usually scale multiplicatively, sometimes even limited-exponentially (like guinsoo), that can often be stronger than just 3 items on useless units."

Fortune is not as easy as people say it is and I often die right after cash out transition these days due to the 5 Fortune heal nerf and increased player damage per round. And now you increase damage taken per round even more!!!???\n\nPrevious patch nerfed luck generated across stage 3, 3->2.  \nNerfed 5 fortune heal 3->2.\n\nThis patch nerfed 7 fortune orb value 16->8 and and luck generated 31->25->12, why 12! this makes no sense at least do 15 so you can try for ToT after 2 rounds. You would still need to try and get 2xToT for a miracle 2 Fortune Crest which will never happen. But now you have to go 3 round for a chance at one ToT at this rate you would get 7 fortune when game ends and you are steamrolled by 3\\* 3/4cost.\n\nConsidering how hard it is to keep the health up until you get an annie at level 8, without accidentally winning a fight, you now nerf tier 4 chances from 22% to 20% so its harder to find an annie. when you find and annie you are typically already at 50hp or so and you just need to survive maybe 3 more loses and then another loss when you transition post cash out.\n\nThis whole process is now to difficult and unforgiving, messing up the loss streak even 1 time at 4 luck means the game is already lost not to mention if you are contested by other fortune players and mess up your loss streak is more likely.\n\nThe 7 fortune is so rare and in my experience required me to cash out the 31/25 luck every stage for the 1st 5 rounds just to stay alive, now you nerf it to 12 luck!?!?\n\nYou are just forcing people to go back to 3\\* 3 costs.\n\n",

It incentivizes the entire lobby to play more than the same 5-6 A/S-tier comps, so it feels refreshing and different each game. Sometimes you'll get a string of emblems to tie together champions you wouldn't normally dream of playing together. Sometimes you'll be forced to choose one of several paths you could go down based on the emblems you get.\n\nI'd argue that Trainer Sentinels is one of the most knowledge-intensive portals in the game, if not the most. And sure, sometimes you'll see high rolls, like Umbral/Reaper/Heavenly or Porcelain/Warden/Arcanist or whatever, but that's part of the fun and part of the risk.\n\nThere will ALWAYS be some elements of RNG at play that determines what comp you try, whether that's in the items you get or the shops you roll. This is just another form of the same thing."

I think 40% drop rate is a fair balance, but I'd rather see that my unit not be trapped for so long in a tea pot (what if it's a coffee person?); maybe scale the duration with like 2/3/15 from 3/3/15.\n\n- **Azir**: His animation time feels super lengthy, maybe scale it with level so he doesn't feel that bad.\n\n- 3 Star reroll carries got nerfed leading to only 4-cost rush. Somehow make them viable once against a 3\\* carries so that players have a chance to play them? An example would be Yone since he won't rely on Heavenly trait.\n\n- **Exalted**: Each combination should have at least 6 units to open up flexible and creative plays for 5 exalted boards.\n\n- UI shift more than anything. Please add damage indicator for stage as we see in hyper roll (I know I have a shitty brain to always remember numbers). \n\nOkay I'll shut up, and wait for them roasts. :')",

The fact that it’s like 15 sets it cycles through means they can still be figured out and if you just Google the best comp for your exalted roll and play exactly those units(and nothing else) you’re just objectively stronger than anyone who doesn’t do that. If it were significantly more random(algorithm) then cooking is possible game to game and being able to slot in exalted becomes a demonstrable skill as opposed to a quick google search"

Very annoying.\nExalted: maybe give out more XP for leveling from the orb. Also, give the units some tank stats too. Damage only when relying on exalted, which has often not many other synergies is quite a risk. \nHwei: might be small, but why is the field in the middle?  Could be the first one. On phone, it's not easily visible when u are fighting at an enemy board and want to switch the unit u paint.\nFortune: a loss streak trait is all or nothing... Underground was the best econ trait IMHO.\nEncounters: some just do the same. Many give items. Some people argue they are too impactful, but I'd rather see some more interesting. ATM most look like augments. U get items or a remover of items... Ok, we already have that. Cheaper lvl up? There are augments for that too. Money? ... U get what I want to say. Why not something that maybe deletes A whole row, making people play with 3 rows on their board? Something impactful but more creative that isn't covered within augments. Adding impassable stones to your board, making melee units go around? Or add a 4th augment slot. Or or or... At least something that differences them from augments. We need more Kayns and cho gaths, yoriks and less gold Tristanas, malphites or kench/kobuko encounter."

Portals were the same thing. People complain about the portals that impact the game a lot like scuttle puddle yet it remains the most popular portal despite those complaints.\n\nReddit will eventually get over it just like any other new addition and we'll see stats showing that the new artifacts are popular among people who aren't getting influenced by daily complaint threads on reddit telling you why you should also hate the new thing"

At this point I was thankful I had secured my top 4 as I am notorious for losing when I should come 1st.  The win streak became long until there was only one other player left. They hit Kayn 3 with 7 Heavenly moments before the final fight. I knew then it would be a fun battle of the titans.\n\nNow this scouting player decided to stick his Kayn right in front of my poor Annie. He instantly started fidget spinning faster than a phase rush Garen. It's important to mention here than one player was good at itemising (not me) so I thought it was going to be a devastating 2nd place. After all we all know that Kayn is ever slightly more broken than Annie. After a brief few seconds, both of us had lost our useless units apart from 1 on my backline. The Kayn was healing every little bit of damage done and Annie was bleeding health as if Briar was behind her.  By some miracle the end game speedup favoured my team and Annie prevailed.\n\nOn a serious note, I'm quite surprised 7 Heavenly Kayn doesn't beat 8 Bruiser Annie with interesting items. Should they not have positioned Kayn in front of Annie? or is the health bonus just too much?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4dfv4a3hnxc1.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e6f13812d33cdede5eeb898d620217b9905b0f",

The first person who gets kayn/lissandra/ashe has almost guaranteed top 4 usually top 2 if nothing crazy happen. \n\nThis is so frustrating cause i see mamy players who force top blitz builds every game.

You can build yorick early game carry, switch items to sylas. You can use Yone early game, switch items to Sett. You can use Darius for either cause that unit is broken. \n\nDuelist can still get top 4, but it needs good augments.

Every single game you will see 2 titans and a BT on someone who just sweeps through everyone else. When they nerf the game, they never touch the items, they touch the champs. It doesn't make sense.\n\nNo items should have stacking affects, every single one should be unique (1 per unit). This set alone, double guinsoos and double titans have been the biggest issues (bard, then yone/gnar/lee, etc). I've seen double titans and BT on Riven and Wukong recently too and while not perfect items for those champs, it still makes them do an insane amount of damage. I can even remember double statik Warwick from back in the day being such an issue and the TFT team has never sat back and thought, maybe we shouldn't allow double stacking effect items on champs? \n\nNot to say that items are the ONLY issue, just that they're a big part of the issue. The lack of most comps being viable is insane this set. I feel like it was the most balanced at the start and only needed to have Bard touched but they ruined so much now to the point all of my games now are, Who can get Ashe or Kayn itemized first?"

Being able to rush levels and play 2* golden soup before anyone else could, could easily eek out a 3rd or 4th. It would likely be slightly stronger now with level 10 available.\n\nLowrolling is nearly always a bot 4, regardless of balancing. That's what makes it a low roll.\n\nWhen it's balanced you're empowered to play around what you get and express your skill. When it's unbalanced it's just RNG on who hits the meta (contested) comps the hardest during their roll down.\n\nWhen \"a gust of wind\" can change the outcome, scouting and positioning actually matters.

Shes a 2 cost unit that carries items on an lvl 8 board and only gets replaced by upgradedhwei or azir.\n\n\nI dont play yorick but i see others consistently top 4 with it so yea you probably didnt play it right the first 20 times infact neither I nor you have probably ever played a game of tft right, this game has so many variables its almost Impossible to play it \"right\". \nSome people go eight everytime they tty to play sage sylas line and sum people top 4 with it all the time....\n\nI made the statement with setsuko to illustrate how pointless this post is, if theres a player that can roflstomp ur lobbies literally trolling then theres nothing holding you or your creativity back.\n\nTruthfully tho i only played set 4.5 and 5 actively and I returned for this set so i cant comment abput all the orher sets. I dont love this set but i think izs enjoyable. Early game lines are a lil to few but late game comps are wide open with alot of flexibility\n\n\nIf you ask me whose weak rn id say its jax and garen by far... but even they have their place in some openers."

Maybe *you* just couldn't see it. \n\nTop comps on tacticstools or any other ranking site/tool, even when played reasonably well, shouldn't guarantee a first or even a top four. \n\nYour ability to adapt what augments/items to take or make, where to position, and your ability to predict the outcome of your opponent's fights (who will bleed and die fastest, who will you be fighting in end game) based on what your opponent are getting and doing, should determine your placement. Sometimes your best moves and predictions won't be enough, and that's okay. \n\nTrue balanced metas are when your skill as a player matters most. Comparing a balanced meta to rock paper scissors is very ironic from my perspective because I'd say that's a much more apt description of the current meta. Very little variance, just replace \"rock paper scissors\" with the top comps on tacticstools and there you go."

Good econ and itemizing properly are important fundamentals that you should focus on first.\n\nAs for viable comps, I wouldn't worry about it right now. I'm not saying there will be stronger comps for patches; there will always be a meta where people find what's strong. I've played since Set 6, and I've seen my fair share of it (Yuumi Supers, Windshield wiper Nilah, Sentinel Ahri, etc.) Instead of focusing on what others are playing, just go the uncontested route. TFT has a way of \"self-balancing\" where the more people force the same comp, the less likely they are to hit. There are a finite number of units in the pool, so if multiple people are playing Kayn, it's more likely to find Ashe, Lee, etc."

Until around Gold-Plat, you’ll get away with running Teemo Reroll if you play the fundamentals correctly.\n\nLearn to manage your gold, learn what units do what, learn what items to slam (and in general which items are good + their purposes), etc.\n\nHonestly, current meta is not as unhealthy as people make it out to be - pretty much every 4 cost that’s meant to be a carry is viable as one, and there’s a few Reroll comps that are strong. Overall, that’s a good place for the meta to be in. Only real issue is that 3 costs aren’t viable at all (I went eighth with a bis high roll Fated Reroll board recently lol), and Dryads are a bit too strong - but nowhere near as bad as Senna or Yone were in previous patches. Balance usually gets better over the course of a Set for obvious reasons."

Just make sure not to contest in Hyper because I feel like the punishment is a lot harsher.\n\nI was Hyper the last 2 or 3 sets and I'm sitting around 3800-4100 this set with a boatload of games but can't crack the final 100 needed to hit it this set due to inconsistency and im just hoping that brute forcing it and playing for fun will get me there"

You can pick things like learning to spell, level augments, kayle augments, pumping up and build a team comp around that. I'd argue if you are picking augments like those as late as stage 5 it's actively harmful to your team comp. Yeah, if you don't have a fortune team going turning down fortune emblem as the first pick at 4-2 or the third pick at 4-2 is largely the same, but the fact that so many cool game altering picks are just wiped off the board when you get to that stage of the game is silly to me."

Heavenly Kayn can use Lissandra because all of the other units around Kayn are just trait bots so it you throw her in for extra econ.\n\nThe moment the meta shifts away from level 8 lottery and requires you to care more about traits would be the moment she stops getting played outside of Porcelain/Arcanist/Fated comps just like in previous patches"

You had no hp to go into 9 and play 5 costs often and if you did you played whatever came along. \n\nThat's the part you're not getting because when everyone plays Bard, Alune, Yone and Aphelios reroll everyone gets to hit those because of less 3 costs in pool. When no one rolls for these because meta now shifted to fast 8 comps then you do you have a very good spot  to go 9, only taking losses in stage 5 which allows to go 9 and to hit Lissandra. It's weird to slam people for that, especially bringing up pro players, when they are a bigger slave to the meta than casual ranked players here are.

He will die to Annie's burn due to omnivamp and damage deficit.

Everyone else is saying that Lissandra was OP all along and was already the best unit in the set even before the meta shift, which is revisionist history because Lissandra's rise to prominence is because of the meta shift. \n\nEven with the 3 cost reroll meta Lissandra had more than enough opportunity to be used if she truly was OP regardless of the meta shift because fast 9 was meta in patches 1 & 2 and outside of DJ WALRUS most high elo players preferred to play additional dragonlords instead of Lissandra.\n\nLissandra's strength right now is specifically because of the meta shift towards not really caring about traits that much + Ashe 1* letting you become instantly stable as long as you have 2* frontline\n\nI wrote this comment 5 hours ago:\n\n> You missed where I said \"and verticals hardly mattering\". She's plug in and play because basically the entire meta right now is plug and play. You just get to 8 and get 2 star backliners like Kaisa, Lillia, and preferably Ashe and get a mix of 2 star frontliners hoping for Nautilus and Annie. Porcelain is the current dominant trait and is low commitment since you only need 2/4 and Amumu pairs well with Naut so it elevates Lissandra even higher. Heavenly Kayn can use Lissandra because all of the other units around Kayn are just trait bots so it you throw her in for extra econ.\n\n> The moment the meta shifts away from level 8 lottery and requires you to care more about traits would be the moment she stops getting played outside of Porcelain/Arcanist/Fated comps just like in previous patches\n\nExplaining that it's because of the meta shift.

I just think Lissandra was always strong, we just didn't go 9 often nor did the meta allow you to with the 3 cost rerolls being so prevalent.

I still don’t think Pantheon is more overloaded than current Lissandra.\n\nSet 1 Pantheon:\n- Provides AoE armour and MR\n- Stuns farthest unit\n- Burns all units it comes into contact with\n- Is extremely tanky\n- Does a considerable amount of damage \n\nSet 11 Lissandra:\n- Provides AP for the team\n- Single target CC\n- AoE damage that also ensures she won’t be stuck on one tank the whole fight (also helps her backline with targeting from what I recall). \n- High single target damage\n- Relatively high chance to print gold and items on a kill.\n\nThey’re kits are at worst equally as overloaded as one another, regardless of whether Pantheon is more OP."

Neither comp used Lissandra. Saying a 1.0+ playrate comp that included 6 5 cost champions just wasn't enough to see her often is wild when we certainly had no problem seeing Hwei/Azir/Udyr/Wukong/Rakan instead.\n\nEven now [the original fast 9 Hwei/Azir comp that's been around since patch 1 still doesn't include her](https://www.metatft.com/comps#TFT11_Dragonlord-TFT11_Azir-TFT11_Hwei)"

Considering even the lowest winrate 5 cost was Xayah at 4.04 I'd even go as far as to say this proved that Lissandra wasn't really that OP in that patch since even Xayah had a close average placement to her and Xayah sucked that patch.

      "comment_body": "I'm not saying she was weak, I'm saying she wasn't OP bonkers broken and always has been like people in this thread are doing. \n\nHer strength has increased in the current meta because of level 8 lottery and the fact that verticals don't matter as much since it's a plug and play meta means you can just throw her in for the extra items and econ without losing anything. In previous patches you are sacrificing ghostly 6, Fated 7, Mythic 5, Storyweaver 7, etc by choosing to just add in a Lissandra with no trait synergy. \n\nHer strength is still the same as it was before in previous patches where she wasn't considered broken OP. If she was then, Chinese pro players would've theory crafted a comp around her like I said in my first reply. She's a strong unit like all the other 5 cost units but the current meta allows her to be more prevalent because Porcelain is the dominant trait and Heavenly Kayn doesn't care to lose a trait bot in exchange for an item printer.\n\nCircling back around to my very first comment where I explained all this, the moment the meta shifts away from level 8 lottery and you actually have to sacrifice those higher trait levels like Fated 7, Ghostly 6, etc Lissandra's playrate would drop even if she had no nerfs to her.\n\nShe's basically this set's version of Set 8 Urgot with threats. When the comp you are playing only needed 7 specific champs you could play Urgot as your 8th champ for free econ at no cost. But if you played a comp with 8 specific champs needed, you didn't play Urgot because your comp would be weaker if you did. Right now the meta comps don't care about anything specific except getting Ashe + a 2nd porcelain, Kaisa + Xayah, or Kayn + Heavenly units as units are so many stronger than traits that traits basically don't matter outside of activating whatever 2 piece you need to activate for your carry."

For those of you not ever fortunate enough to see the boss in true action, the guy before a fight lifts **ALL UNITS** on the board.  I throw a gg into chat, knowing my position is untouchable.  I start to knock out players - sett is doing 150,000 damage.  You read that right, all from thousands of ad.  Next round 200,000.\n\nI hit naut three.  Now it's over - my arrogance, oh my arrogance.  Last fight is upon me for first place and the guy is storyweaver.  He's at like 10 health, me one loss away as well.  The guy donkey rolls for irelia three, knowing it's his only chance.\n\nOf course he hits.  Why wouldn't he hit?  I think to myself - *\"Sett is loaded with 450,000 damage, and I know that bitch doesn't have 450,000 hp.  And he sold half his board, so naut is hitting the whole thing anyways.  I should be fine.\"*  The final round starts.\n\nRemember when I said Sett benches all units earlier?  Well, in the meantime while the boss is growing those sweet guns, Irelia decides she doesn't need to wait for no man to finish gym time.  She proceeds to armor shred and bring all of my units down to 1 hp before the benching is complete, and when the fight begins, all my units die immediately.\n\nBesides being tilted, I know know a valuable fact about tft.\n\nIrelia 3 > Sett three.  Thanks for coming to my yordle yant.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6kisnts4axc1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=804efee4d60bca58e30dd47b5d3d892ec6892703",

Hwei/Azir/Xayah: kills everything in 1 cast except udyr and units with items that grant invulnerability (with exception of other 3* 5 costs with tank items maybe)\n4. Rakan/Udyr/Wukong: beefy but very slow on clearing the board (Rakan and wukong can be stunlocked before ulting, not sure about udyr)\n5. Sett: literal garbage 💀 bro loses to almost every other 3* 5 cost and sometimes even to well placed 3* 4 costs…ult aoe stays the same and requires 2-3 casts to clear the board which makes him the slowest of all the other units to win"

Sett if the other one I hit a lot, similarly he's just not as contested as much, pretty much only fated and occasionally porcelain boards. Azir/Wuk/Rakan/Udyr feel near impossible, only hit each of them once or twice, hit Liss a few times before this patch but it's near impossible right now, and Hwei is pretty hard because a lot of people like holding him to paint."

Giant's Slayer isn't going to do much against them, but Edge of Night will often save Kayn from getting blown up and win you the round. If more people were playing bruisers right now then I'm sure GS would be the way to go.\n\nSpark is so good on Sylas right now likely due to how popular magic resist is in general.

The only requirement you have is getting to your units, which is way to easy. you can play whatever 4 cost unit you hit and even if another person hits the exact same board it is not unbelievable to see 2-3 player with their units 2\\*  \n\n\nOn the other hand, if you hit a carry augment or go for a 3 cost carry you 100% need them 3\\*, you need great items and a comp that complements them perfectly. you need to hit your stuff, include even getting the carry augment itself. (not to mention 3\\* your units takes time and money away from you leaving you in a lower level compared to level 8 rush people, for you to have a powerspike in a unit that still has an easy chance to get outscaled by 4 cost units quite easily)  \n\n\nWith that being said, i hope to make my point clear why i think the 4 cost heavy meta sucks. They simply made 2/3 cost units to underperfoming while buffing 4 cost, making the gap of power you get by picking a non 4 cost carry so small that two 2\\* 4 cost units (24 gold) will always be better than a 3\\* 3 cost unit (27 gold) and definetely way better than 3\\* 2 costs (18 gold).  \n\n\nPLEASE, just revert the 4 cost buffs...

And hitting 4 cost units is way too easy.\nOnly the part of upgrading your units will be addressed, while the power of them will stay untoched. \n\nI don't know how much lowering the odds and changing the player damage will change things\n\nI can just say that losing to a 4 cost board sucks when you have 2 3* 3 cost units with BIS items while your opponent has only good items and not good augments.\nIt doesn't feel good when you get a carry augment then hit all your units and still lose to Annie Ashe.\nIt doesn't feel good when you can't try out new stuff because it will ultimately fail against 2* 4 cost units."

Watching Frodan VODs where he casts pro games and even does an in-depth review of his and other's games. \n3. Using tftacademy to research viable comps (I usually only go for S and A tier comps if I wanna climb)\n4. SCOUTING is very important, especially when transitioning during the end of stage 3 into stage 4 so that you know which comps are being contested, and then you can plan your game from there.\n5. Your opening board does not exactly mean that it is your end game board. Sometimes you will need to partially or completely pivot during the midgame. Some scenarios could be because you're contested, or you see that nobody is playing a really good S-tier comp. Use the team planner often during rolldown so you don't get dizzy.\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of what I did during my climb to masters. Good luck on your climb fellow tactician!"

Look up hidden mechanics. Try to recognize where you lack information or strategy. I know I'm good at econing and end game board composition. I lack keeping tempo, which points out I lack scouting time. \n\nIt's all about finding holes in how you go about the game. Start questioning things like, when should I roll? When should I level? Etc. Sometimes rolling down at 7 will conserve more hp than ruining your hp to get to 8 before you roll down. \n\nGood luck and have fun!"

  "self_text": "Just hit a game where I hit level 10 super early due to massive fortune cash out, had 145 hp to start the game, and encounters also gave a lot of gold plus khazix evolve made it cost 3 gold to level up. So I hit 10 in stage 4 and had like 30 gold left to reroll, allowing me to 2 star multiple legendary's. Had Hwei, Sett, Azir, Udyr, and Rakan 2 starred. Was just the perfect fortune 5 scenario besides of course, hitting fortune 7/9. Keep in mind, I finished 7th while experimenting different frontlines and carries. Usually I keep fortune 5 + Annie tank to maintain the 2 hp heal to heal back up.\n\nAnyways .. since I had multiple legendary 2 stars, I figured I'd try to front line them for a change. I had 4 magnetic removers so plenty of room for error. First try, I had Sett frontlining but he got shredded pretty quick, didn't do much damage either. Second try Udyr goes untargetable leaving my entire backline exposed. 3rd try, Rakan just loses health and his shield doesn't out sustain the enemy damage. Keep in mind this entire time I had 2 star azir and hwei back line as well. 3 good items on azir.. didn't work out so I took them off and put them on hwei. STILL DIDN'T WORK OUT. Their abilities are so clunky and end up missing or in azirs case, spending 10 seconds charging up enough mana to kill a 1 hp target, and going on cool down again. Turned out the only reliable back line carries are irelia and xayah for damage, and lissandra is nice for her utility. Anyways I concluded that a 1 star annie is a better tank than any of the 5 cost frontliners atm, they're just not good as tanks compared to last set when illaoi was phenomenal. Better off building damage or mana regen on them. Azir and hwei carries are not great solo, hwei is good for printing champions tho Azir is just useless on a legendary board, he heavily relies on traits to be useful.\n\nSorry for poor formatting, was typing this out while lose streaking on fortune :D",

Reason why is Irelia and Xayah damage is enough with trickshot from teemo and duelist from Tristana. And lissandra is also very OP right now even without items, just her ability to remove frontline units before they can cast their ability is useful enough to make it work.

And for your carries it depends mostly on what the enemy carries target (furthest enemy, biggest clump etc)\n\nAlso this video might help if you wanna get really deep (I haven’t watched it though tbh): https://youtu.be/mc2n7dNJv10?si=8yR3rYeoZqM6KfBF"

By the late game, though, you can't itemize enough units for that to work, and your front line probably includes two or three trait bots (Neeko and Malphite in Heavenly, for instance).  So once I have my itemized tank, I reverse this - build the big tank in the center and the sides as \"crumple zones\" to control where the enemy front line will go.  With snipers, I'll put the big tank a little farther from the carries, since they have to break through thatfront line first and I want the enemy to crumple away from my damage.  \n\nOn the other hand, if my main tank uses Gargoyle's Stoneplate (Galio, Diana) I want them anchoring one end of the line so more than one or two enemies target them.  With something like Storyweaver where I want the enemy to come to me to maximize Kayle, anchor the end close to the carries and crumple towards them.\n\nWith something like Duelists or Kayn, you're more focused on getting the flank, so melee carries go to the outside and tanks close to them to hold open the hole for Kayn/Lee to push in through."

If 5 tanks then the middle-left and middle-right are my “guards” that are slightly less important than my tackles. Is this a good way of doing it? Idk, but I find it fun."

I get your point, but the argumentation is invalid.\n\nAlso it has always been that way. People play strong combs, shocket.\n\nYou cant get mulched/boiling point im every game and win with a reroll, so you play a strong early board, winstreak to lvl 8/9 and play Kaisa or ashe, depending on what units you first hit.\n\nPeople like you are blaming players for doing whats intended.\n\nI mean, in a perfect world you would have 3 costs a little better performing, but I would bet you that you can still make Alune Invoker work if you get perfect augments and manage to hit 3star and streak before the 4cost players. People dont try it cause its more risky.\n\nI won with Kog reroll yesterday, hit him and cho 3 at 3-1 and then streaked stage 3 and 4 into fast 9 with Hwei and 2star legendaries.

Yone dashes and takes out the squishies. Trickshot can bounce to the backline. Irelia can hit the backbine. Kayne you hope wraps around and kills backline. Gnar you hope gets a lucky rock off on the backline. So much of this current meta feels like different comps that can ignore insanely tanky frontline and just kill backline first.

Problem is though is that you are inferring how the game played out based off and end game screen shot, and that’s just not how it played out at all. \n\nhttps://lolchess.gg/profile/na/Ramsonite-NA1/set11\n\nYou can look at the lobby and see that 5 people all died in round 5, which is extremely fast. The top 3 people all went to round 7, because they were so far ahead of everyone. \n\nThe reason they were so far ahead of everyone was because of a few things that happened that the rest of the lobby had no control over. \n\n1: It was Lillia portal, and the 1st and 2nd augment came at 2-3 and 2-5. With the 2nd augment being tailored, it’s overly weighted to benefit a comp like heavenly that can be weighted towards early, which you can see that one of them got a heavenly spat and the other got an edge of night augment. \n\n2: The first place guy found a Kaisa at 2-5 and had 3 full items on him. The edge of night heavenly guy found a Lee Sin at 2-5 or 2-6, and then he ended up 2 staring it during round 3 lvl 6 or 7 without rolling. The other heavenly guy just had a strong heavenly Darius opening that snowballed because of the early spat."

And because at least half the lobby is always trying for one of these builds, someone is bound to hit, and if you aren't the one who hits, then you will bleed out to a bot 4. \n\nIt's also annoying because certain units like Lissandra are over-tuned, even for a 5-cost. A high damage, 3 second stun, combined with displacement, AND it gives bonus loot on kill is insane. \n\nI'm more curious about what would happen if they made Porcelain emblem uncraftable.

If you are trying to say “It’s contested, don’t play it”, that doesn’t negate the fact that it has a very high average placement of 4.17. The average placement for an average TFT game is 4.5 as that’s the average of 1-8. So it is an above average comp. \n\n2. 2 porcelain 4 invoker averages 5.21, which is horrible. Unless you are saying 4 porcelain 4 invoker? But then you lose either Naut or a second sniper for ash assuming you don’t have an emblem and are lvl 9. Note that I’m not saying 4 invoker isn’t strong, but it has a lower avg placement compared to 6 invoker, and I’m arguing why verticals are strong here. \n\n3. More to your point, if 6 invoker has a 4.17 when its units are contested for a patch, doesn’t that mean they will be stronger when its units aren’t contested on the coming patches? Your point would make sense to me if the stats weren’t very good for it being a 6 piece trait compared to umbral or even storyweaver, but it’s stats are still good"

All the units on the left are basically useless, lvl1 kayle is mostly useless, Ashe with staff is almost useless, Lee sin has 0 items, useless... Which leaves us with galio (good items), Irelia (medicore items) and sett (really medicore items). So u have 3 units that do something actually. Exalted is nice, but u only buff those 3 meaningfully, of which then, sett and galio are tanks. So your unoptimal itemized Irelia needs to carry. And she only has duelist 2 active, also not good. Porcelain is on your ranged units, rendering it useless. Sniper... Those snipers have 0 items, they won't carry. Umbreal 2... Ok, small small shield. Bruiser 2? A tiny little bit more HP on a lot of lvl 1/2/3 units. having sage active is maybe the best u could have besides exalted, and then there is also 2 dragonlord s for small buff. That one red kayle... Gives your irelia a bit attack speed that she isn't getting from her 3rd item cause u are at 0 gold and the item (I don't know the name) (that gives attack speed based on gold and sometimes exec gold) needs 30 gold in bank. So u have an Irelia with 2 medicore items (gun blade and death blade), no attack speed, no red buff/Morello for burn damage and no rage blade for more attack speed. If you play such a board, your irelia needs BIS items and maybe Ashe also needs good stuff to be secondary carry. ATM your exalted damage boost goes lost (at least to some point) cause your possible carries (Irelia and Ashe, maybe lee sin/aphelios) have bad or 0 items. Lastly, there is no OP lvl 3 4 cost, or even 3 cost unit, only quite standard leveld units, nothing stands out to make someone think \"wow, that one really turns the tides\"\n\nOne kayn might rip through your whole board alone, he just sustains and your board has no burst damage neither anti heal.

If you went level 10 and used all your augments to get there, only to play irelia, and I guess sett (but sett is trash outside fated), then you did something wrong.

Imo, the only good sets overall were 3, 4, 6 and 10 but all of them had some rough metas.\n\n5 was bad because of forgotten items. Essentially you had these items you could choose and they were “cursed” but some were broken on specific units. 5.5 was awful because of how strong verticals were. I think there was a meta where you could run vertical forgotten with a 1 cost vayne carrying you to level 8 or 9. Lux, a 3 cost, was also dumb. You didn’t need to 3 star her, just run shojin shiv? \n\n\n7 sucked because of the dragons. I’ve never cared for the colossal sort of units that take two spaces up on your board. The comps also felt pretty restricting. Essentially you just played a comp the exact same way every time, rarely deviating from how it should be played. Shyvana was a fake 5 cost. \n\n8 was bad because of hero augments. Once you chose one, you’re locked into that comp. The 5 costs were also a bit too good. You could throw fidd/urgot on any board due to their utility. Aside from that, I recall it being similar to set 7 where you rarely deviated or saw much variety from within a comp outside of adding the threatened 5 costs.\n\n9 was garbage. Terrible metas and little legends were dumb. You didn’t really have to learn how to play the game due to them. Like, pick pandoras and hard force 1 of the broken comps. The urf meta was terrible too. Verticals were absolutely busted in that set and some of those metas were some of the worst tft. Multicasters were dumb. Bilgewater rfc was dumb. Mordekaiser triple rfc was dumb. Kaisa/yasuo meta was also awful"

Mage Spat my beloved...\n\nSet 5: Made me quit. Worst set ive ever played. \n\nSet 5.5: didnt give it a chance but it looked better than 5.\n\nSet 6: Augments were a gamechanger and the set itself was just a banger. \n\nSet 6.5: people dont seem to like it but i cant really remember a difference. Had a blast all the way through. Also double-up release. \n\nSet 7: Dragons bad. They were a balance nightmare but shimmerscale was a hella fun econ trait. Made me a gambling addict. Climbed to Diamond by forcing Astral emblem Soraka. Not healthy for the game but so much fun. \n\nSet 7.5: Better than 7 thanks to lagoon trait and Sohm. \n\nSet 8: i liked hero augments. i liked admins. Set was great aside from yuumi new year. Also threats were a great idea. \n\nSet 8.5: Even more fun. Thanks to the new trait after it became balanced. (Forgot the name. Lucian, Panth, Ezreal etc)\n\nSet 9: Theme was cool but the whole \"prismatic trait\" idea was a mistake that affected that and all future sets. Legends really made this set a bad experience for me. \n\nSet 9.5: Bilgewater was a mistake. Vertical fiesta etc... Somehow worse than 9. \n\nSet 10: Banger set.

Other things things get nerfed to the ground due to a synergy with one of the random events that blows up high level games without ever registering for most people's games, which also ends up feeling bad for both types of game.

A good deal of Dragonlands also stirred to ~~chinese~~ eastern visuals also, so for me, the theme felt kinda rehashed.   \n  \n**Units: Good**   \nThere are some amazing units this set. Kobuko is a favorite of mine for example. Sylas, Irelia, Voli, Hwei, Zyra, Alune, etc. are all fun and well executed. Sadlyl, we have some clear bad designs such as Lissandra and Lux.  \n  \n**Traits: Good**  \nWill probably feel like this deserve a downgrade after they chance Heavenly and Ghostly to be more of the same. Porcelain is a nice trait, the problem is in the units themselves. Storyweaver is a nice addition as long as Riven, Sivir and Garen are basicly trait bots. If (but let's be honest: When) they fuck up and make all of these amazing units by their own right Storyweaver is gonna be a nightmare again. The only two misses I'd give to this set are Arcanists and Fortune. Arcanists doesn't feel good as a vertical trait to me and Fortune is well... Fortune, gotta milk the gatcha kids.  \n  \n**Set Mechanic**: Bad   \nEncounters were a complete miss on their end in my book. Even worse, I think they didn't even try to do something good, just tried Augments with extra steps and see if people like that.\n\nAll of this should give you a set that feels mid.

Lissandra is busted for sure but try to play around it/play it yourself as a +1. I also love watching the competitive scene and I'd say almost every pro said that they loved the patch. Every 4 cost is used in meta comps which compared to previous patches was not the case whatsoever and the meta is still developing with people figuring out over the last week that things like Sylas carry with sage is completely viable. We've had way worse game states in the past (recently set 9 cough cough) and I think this patch is actually very solid and flexible."

How you flex when you don’t hit is a skill expression for high elo. This set you can’t even do that. \n\nBtw at the same patches where ad flex was popular, there are multiple playable, top 4 viable comps. Namely Lulu riven senna reroll, a fully capped tf board, pentakill is also very playable, executioner, ahri spell weaver. You can often top 4, and that’s good enough. For top 1, you need something that really makes your board destroy the 2nd guy which can’t happen every game.\n\nAd flex was popular because of heartsteel traits where crazy cash out happens and you can go level 9 and 10 then play Exodia. It’s the same as Fortune now but less risky. \n\nThis set was fine at first, just needed some nerf to the reroll comps, some buffs to 4 cost chanps. Riot just straight up murdered reroll, over buffed Porcelain and Ashe. How could that happened ei? It feels really bad to play this patch. Ever try to get past an Annie with a Porcelain emblem lol.

You can’t be selectively choosing at what point in time to state Ezreal or ad flex dominate 90% of the games and say oh btw Lucian was trash 90% of the set. So what was it? Ezreal is the carry to stabilize your board, not a capped out board where you replace him with Jhin or just play 4 big shots. And how often in high elo can you max cap an Exodia board? You itemize Ezreal because you can, no one puts items on Ezreal while they have a Lucian 2 with no items.\nWhen rolling down on 8 if you don’t hit Ezreal headliner, you can put items on Caitlyn or Zed, go 9, play Jhin or Lucian or both and still beat the Ezreal player, depends on the game. There are ways to play for top 4 or even top 1 if you don’t hit Ezreal. This set? If you don’t hit Ashe and Annie, you’re hoping for a top 5-6.\n\nThe patch before Lucian/ezreal, you can play MF bard reroll, Country reroll, executioner with the similar items. There were a lot of viable comps, which is the complaining about set 11, not a lot of comps to play.\n\nI was Master 500LP last set btw. Not flexing. This set I’m Master 200LP already."

      "comment_body": "Take a look at the World Championship last set for example. Reroll dominated all games. It was Kayle, senna, lulu, kata, some bard here and there. When a player went for Ad flex and got first, it’s because they were playing for top 1 or they need the top 1. Not every time you can play ad flex then go Exodia where the tempo of the lobby is high and also the ad flex comp is so expensive, you will bleed out before you got them. \nMilala took a big risk raising the stake, looked at how he was nervous and shaking. It was either top 1 or nothing, and ad flex should definitely won because it’s the strongest board. No one will go for it if reroll can comfortably beat it at 6 stage."

Last set I gave up and accepted that Emerald was my ceiling, but I'd like to try and improve and go further this set as I really like the theme and aesthetics of it. \n\nNow I'm not about to write a rant post about how <SPECIFIC UNIT(S)> are ruining the game and how <CURRENT META COMPS> are the only way to win, because I know that can't be true (and there's enough posts about that on this subreddit already). My opponents are clearly better at the game than me, but I am not sure where I need to focus my attention to improve so I'm looking for advice from the lovely people on this here subreddit. 🙂 \n\nOne thing which I notice but I'm not sure how to improve on is that when I feel like I need to level to 8 or 9, I rarely have enough gold to actually look for any units once I reach that level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy profile since I know it'll be asked for: [https://tactics.tools/player/euw/Sentik/EUW](https://tactics.tools/player/euw/Sentik/EUW)",

I use tactics.tools to look at stats specifically for this comp’s augments, itemizations unit variation, etc. not the regular stats tools.\n\nI don’t think I’m that skilled of a player but I do spend a lot of time playing and trying to consistently top 4. IMO one can only have so much skill in a game based on RNG. I feel like people don’t talk about how much time it takes to climb higher ranks. I believe that anyone who seriously plays TFT can hit challenger as long as they have the time to do so. Of course, that’s assuming more time spent = skill progression to some extent.\n\nhttps://tactics.tools/player/na/moonpıe"

After multiple hours/day of playing and watching TFT streamers, I could only reach Gold IV at the moment.\n\nThis is the first time I have pulled off 10SW and also against a very strong guy with 10 heavenly + 4 reaper and a long win streak as well. Words can’t describe how hyped I was when I can finally reach lvl 10 to add every piece into one another.

  "self_text": "Honestly, I don’t think it fixes any issues in the previous patches but brought spotlight to 1-3 costs underperforming so it had its ups and downs. However, some changes would not make any difference to units that need changes. \n\n-Kog’Maw, Riven, and Zoe have gotten changes and it looks amazing. They needed some sort of push to be reliable in their current state and going them as carries has always felt like grief and a risk to try. So giving them the fighting edge was a welcome change\n\n-Darius and Morgana changes are something I would say is questionable only because \n1. Darius is def strong in terms of damage dealing but the reason why umbral suffers isn’t because they aren’t doing enough damage but because them having a chance to tank damage throughout the fights is unreliable, not enough front line either. I main umbral in the past so I have had 100 games to see the flaw in its comp. Maybe giving Darius a slight armor and Mr boost would have been helpful. \n2. 3 star Morgana seems like a viable thing to go for now with that huge boost in increased damage, however Morganas chill effect is pretty weak and putting carry items on her beforehand feels like a risky move before getting her to 3 star with more carry options around.\n\n-I’m not going to try not to be upset by this change as decreasing her loot chance is a good nerf but her ability to cast over and over and over and over….you get my point. Her loot chances was not just her biggest issue, it was her ability to keep casting continuously and still get away with it. It’s so stupid too cause you don’t need her to have any traits and she’d still be good to have in any comp. \n\nThe devs honestly try their best to improve the game often and I respect them wholeheartedly for these changes. But certain changes don’t feel like they haven’t been looked into more. Hopefully they recognize this. One more additional question, Volis healing doesn’t matter if he never gets the chance to cast it, so why not increase his attack speed just a bit instead? I’ve said my fair share, what do you guys think of this recent patch notes?\n\n",

Your suggestion to buff his mr and armor makes no sense. He’s already broken with titans + healing, like very hard to kill and a buff would send him overboard. Buffing him for umbra also makes no sense since 1 costs are normally trait bots for verticals unless you 3 star him: I do ageee that umbral may need a tiny butt in defenses, though. Yorick is shit and sylas is ok but you don’t really want him as your main tank. Yone is a problematic design and Darius is a 1 cost"

This season that doesn't seem to be the meta and there doesn't seem to be a 100% consistent top 4 team like in the past so I've been struggling lol. I've noticed that ive been getting 1 tapped by bronze Kayles and Kaisa so I decided to try some of these \"fast 8\" teams. Unfortunately it has not worked out yet for me at all. I go on a lose streak and buy xp up when the guides tell me to, then I roll down 100+ gold, get *most* the champions, never all, and I go on a 5 or 6 win streak just to lose once and get eliminated. How do you guys A) build a strong enough team to survive with enough health to win WHILE saving the econ to fast 8 and B) get the final team immediately strong enough to full win out",

Or alternatively if you get lucky, you can start by win streaking and maintain that strong early board with the bare minimum needed so you can save up gold while not losing much health either.\n\nFor example if you hit storyweaver 3 in the minion rounds, you don't even need to level up to 4 in the first 2 pvp rounds and youll probably win them, but also you might want to make a small investment, level up to 4, and put in a 2* unit, and from then on you don't have to spend a single gold (except to buy one unit al level 5) until you level up to 6.\n\nReally depends on your early board, a guide can't tell you the intricacies of what to do when you hit a story weaver 3 and one 2* unit, vs what to do when you somehow don't get three units with the same traits in all 3 minion rounds."

And some 5 tier units.    \n- In low health get the best units/items for you in carrousels. That way you can get 4/5 tier units that fits.\n- Eventually it decays like in 5-2 when other players hit their comps.    \n-push to 9 when you start losing, roll and try to 2* all your 4 and get  the 5 units that you need."

They are a good source of inspiration but you must just adapt to your game.\n\nWhat I did to hit plat (and slowly climbing) is quite simple : I always try to have a strong board in early game by trying to make 2\\* units (and keeping an eye to their traits obviously). Keep in mind that now, a streak provide less gold than before so even if it's important, I prefer to gain a little less gold but way less HP.\n\nSome unit are god tier : making a Darius 2 is insane if you hit him before the pvp. Also I always buy what could make me a early storyweaver even if I know I won't play the unit after that. Facing a strong opener with a Kayle make things easier.\n\nI also nearly always slam my items. But if you were plat before, you don't need to hear that because you're already doing this.\n\nThen I choose what comp I'll play (and here, obviously there is some better comp than others and guides are usefull) and you pivot. Just keep in mind it's obviously better to have a good not perfect comp and take a third place than trying to have all the units a guide show you with BIS, never two star them and go bottom.\n\nSome high elo players could disagree with me so feel free to correct me but as OP talked about plat elo, and as I'm totally in, I thought my advice could be usefull."

If you have 100 gold, you are absolutely not doing fast 8 right. Unless you have an augment, you're not getting more interest by saving that much gold. You should be spamming that buy exp button."

I had to hit level 9 in order to roll and play 5 cost boards and it gave me experience to level to 9. \n\nThe other times I got dummies, triple hullbreaker, triple sniper focus, all gold, or a three star 3 cost. All I can say is that those rewards definitely felt like a boost to my board, but I don't think they were ever game win defining. I did play a game recently where I was kai'sa with an already established board.\n\nI took it and got 4 emblems that gave me inkshadow, sniper, warden, and fated. I think if I had the fated board it would've been helpful, but those emblems were not pivotable in my position and it actually cost me a 1st (I took 2nd). I'd say that was the only time I lost a game because I took call to chaos and it in no way benefitted me. Overall I think the augment is very fun and it's definitely worthy of prismatic."

      "comment_body": "The first thing I notice is that your damage dealt is absurdly low, which means you are losing a ton of fights early game. This is not a comp where you can afford to be hard losing early game. Rather, this comp should be played from ahead. 90% of the time your early game of this comp is going to be playing Darius holding Kayn/Lee Sin items. Things like Gnar, Yone, Volibear, Qiyana, or Khazix can be acceptable, but mostly it is just Darius. If you can't make a good slam early game on a strong unit, you shouldn't be playing this line unless you have an insane first augment. On that note, you really want good combat augments. \n\nThe very bottom game, you took Latent Forge. This goes against the main idea outlined above, only 35 damage dealt. Not a Heavenly spot. You are basically gambling to get Death's Defiance or Infinity Force and insane augments.\n\nThe next Heavenly game you went 8th, augments look good, and items are great. But you only did 16 damage here. Something must really be extremely wrong with the early game, so can't tell from this end game board.\n\nNext game that's an 8th. Radiant Relics start, not sure which one you chose (Bloodthirster or Rascal's Gloves), but either should be really good with a Darius start. Other augments are insanely good. You really don't want Rascal's Gloves on your Lee Sin though. You have an EoN and HoJ on Diana. You want this on a carry, especially when you are playing Not Today and Little Buddies. Gloves can go on Diana or some 5 cost that fits in the comp. If you slammed Gloves onto Lee Sin, is probably worth to pop it off when you find Lee Sin 2* even if you have to sell Kayn to move items. Missing Malphite is a big deal here as well.\n\nLast game looks much better already from doing 77 damage. Good first two augments, Banshee's, 2 Heavenly spats, and rolled Death's Defiance which is of course good. I would say this spot looks pretty good. Not sure how you did early game, but you would like to drop Neeko for something better. Lee Sin, Irelia, Rakan, Udyr, even a second Kayn/Wukong. Neeko's Heavenly bonus is HP which scales poorly late game, and playing a strong unit with a TG is worth more than the 6/7 Heavenly diff.\n\nBy the way, if you see Sylas is not very contested, you can play Sylas 2* on this comp with no synergies until you go level 9 and find better units. Basically buy Sylas on your rolldown. Particularly in the game you have Hwei, it is a good holder of Rascal's Gloves and gets strong Little Buddies value."

    {
      "comment_body": "From my experience I find way more success building Kayn more bruiserish, rather than going full glass canon. He has enough damage anyways and something like Steraks helps with random oneshots.  \nImo, LW is a bait. You want Evenshroud on your tank to free up a slot on Kayn. Whenever your Kayn needs that penetration attacking frontline your Evenshroud tank will be near and if Kayn dives backline and splits with your evenshroud holder he doesn't need penetration anyways.  \nEven though this is considered an S+ comp that doesn't really need any specific augment imo Harmacist or Grim Reaper makes a HUGE difference and allow you to ditch HOJ for a deffensive item.  \nThat one slot you freed up by ditching LW/HOJ you use to build QSS, because there will be at least 2 people in the lobby who's parents don't love them and they play Lisandra. You're not ever winning Lissandra with Kayn without QSS on both Kayn and your main tank. So I opt into Sterak's, BloodThirster, QSS/Evenshroud build.\n\nTake my opinion with a grain of salt as I'm pisslow. Just sharing my experience."
    },
    {
      "comment_body": "Just wanted to respond to this as someone who has played this comp a ton this patch.\n\nLast Whisper is very good on Kayn because of the stats it gives. AD, AS, and most importantly crit rate. Basically everything you can ask for. Likewise for Hand of Justice it gives crit. Even if you have Harmacist, you should still build HoJ when reasonable.\n\nThe other \"problem\" with Evenshroud is you don't have a tank and don't have resources to invest tank items so your Evenshroud user dies quickly. I'm pretty sure the item is actually best put on Lee Sin (or Wukong if you have this 2 star) if you need to make it because you don't have Last Whisper. Stats also agree Lee Sin is a better holder than Diana or a Heavenly unit.\n\nQSS is quite good in certain spots for sure. Not an early slam, and generally ends up on Wukong or Lee. Position so QSS takes Liss ult. \n\nGrim Harvest is an awful augment I think. Harmacist is actually not that insane in the comp either. Good for sure, but there are many others I would pick. Notable is Little Buddies, Inspiring Epitath, Combat Caster, Martyr, Gifts from the Fallen, and Keepers."

That other player will  end up finding their own units and now everyone’s too poor to block them.

The set is overall fun. I will add that the Encounters are more fun than what I said previously. I actually like when an Encounter pops up, thanks to both the visuals and the extra loot. \n\nThe augments remain \"okay,\" as I didn't receive many fun augments, and I felt that my choices weren't interesting -- not much of a deciding factor since there are other fun elements.\n\nThe items are overall good. I did get a bunch of defensive items in some games this time, and it felt less exciting than receiving offensive ones; this isn't necessarily an inherent issue, but a probably a symptom of playing ranked in previous sets and getting griefed by defensive items; but I played norms and it wasn't an issue there.\n\nI played more comps this time, and there was nothing that stood out comp-wise. The visuals of all of the comps were exciting, and the champion abilities were impactful. 5 costs are the best units.\n\nThe games lasted 35-40 minutes, and I felt that it was a long time still. I think I would have enjoyed a condensed game where I skip some parts to get to one comp to another more quickly, so I may try out hyperroll to see how different the time feels since I am not playing ranked.\n\nThe biggest downside so far is that there is a lot to learn, which can make it harder to enjoy playing. Also, as I expected, the issue with me losing some of the games was that I couldn't fully realize the comp or try out different things before dying. I would have probably enjoyed being able to continue to play after death in order to savor the moment.\n\nThat's all for now. So far so good.",

It usually means you have a power spike at leveling that unit(s) to 3. \n\nFast 9 is like it sounds, you're trying to hit 9 ASAP while passively collecting your comp. It's a late game strategy, typically. That means you may even econ and attempt leveling faster than typical tempo. "
    },
    {
      "comment_body": "These are basically two different ways to make your board stronger. \n\nFirst option is you spend gold to reroll (costs 2 gold) and try and find 9 copies of a unit(s) to make a 3-star unit. This is a reroll comp. \n\nSecond option is you spend gold on leveling (in intervals of 4 gold). By being a higher level, not only can you field more units, but your odds of finding a higher cost unit increases. You can see the odds for each level here: https://www.metatft.com/tables/shop-odds\n\nRight now, 4 costs are extremely strong, though that may change in a few days. Most games revolve around going to level 8 as fast as possible to get the 22% odds for a 4 cost. The usual gameplan is to not reroll at all in the early game and save your gold for interest and leveling. You usually go to level 8 on 4-2 or 4-5 (the latter is probably more reasonable for a new player). Then roll for 4/5 costs and whatever synergies make sense. You can look up top comps to see what you might want to aim for, but right now even just throwing in 4 cost frontline tanks with no traits active is quite strong."

      "comment_body": "So when you get level 8 you just blow all your gold on rerolls generally? Or like roll down to 50 gold?"
    },
    {
      "comment_body": "You roll as much gold as needed to have a stable board. A fast 8/9 strategy will sacrifice some HP for econ, so you need to roll to start winning. Ideally that's getting a 2* frontline unit and a 2* carry. In some cases that may be desperately rolling all your gold, but that's not ideal. Current meta that type of thing is common though, especially since units are very contested. You also have to know how strong units are and what your opponents' boards look like. For example, right now you might be stable with a 2* 4 cost tank and a 1* Ashe with good items.\n\nThe leveling guide another person linked is useful, and knowing the concepts of why/when to level is important to be able to adapt to each game. For example, a typical game you would have 4-2 or 4-5 as a perfect leveling interval, meaning you go to level 8 without spending excess gold. This is because it costs 4 gold to gain 4 exp, but each round you receive 2 exp. This means that if you were to level to 8 on 4-1 or 4-3, you would have an extra 2 exp overleveled. On 4-4 you don't get any exp due to carousel. Then on 4-5 is another perfect interval, while 4-6 is off, and 4-7 is perfect again.\n\nHowever, in this set exp gets messed up more often due to encounters. If there is an encounter on 4-2 for example, it may add an extra \"round\" where you don't get any exp. In which case 4-3 is a perfect interval (here 4-5 is carousel). \n\nIt's completely acceptable to level off interval though. For example, you are pushing a win streak, you may want to level to secure the streak. Or you are very rich already, then leveling early gives higher shop odds if you only lose 1/2 gold of econ."

If you see you are going to lose the fight, put the emblem on that unit and activate 3 Fortune. Then next round, sell that unit to drop back down to 2 Fortune and repeat. On the other hand, if you are going to win the fight, you leave the Fortune emblem on the bench so don't have Fortune on the board. This preserves your loss streak and keeps all your stacks.\n\nPlaying 5 Fortune is unnecessary especially with this tech. You can play a decently strong board to kill a few units against the strong players, which saves way more HP than 5 Fortune does. Meanwhile the other Fortune players should be taking huge losses and lose once to your stronger cashout."

It's a lot to manage on top of everything else you are doing...its very easy to forget to drop it or waste time focusing on it instead of planning your next stage etc. It's not easy to multitask while focusing on that every single round.

The top players you mentioned, who play fortune actually do go crazy every round and scout every potential board and find the best positioning to kill some units on as many boards as possible while making sure to lose to every board...\n\n\n\nBut not doing any of that and slamming an item every round is not hard to do, when your playing fortune what else are you thinking about during the fights? I recommend planning your late game in team builder during fights that you can slam fortune emblem because your fighting a good board. And that gives a bunch of time to focus on whatever else.\n\n\n\nIt's another one of those things that if you do it a few times it will just become second nature."

Ultimately it was actually fun having a variety of comps to go.\n\nSet 10 when ya lose it was pretty clear why ya lost, yes there were meta comps but they weren’t nearly as oppressive as this set. \n\nPlus in Set 11 how you win or lose sometimes makes no sense and people high roll a lot more this set than I’ve seen in previous sets with all the 3 starred 4 costs and 5 costs lately."

Who needs that when I can keep Econ up while have a real board and still pushing levels because between portals and encounters I’m loaded.\n\nIf people want to see less crazy comps they need to stop immediately going for things like prismatic party and crab rave that accelerate the lobby like crazy. Yet every game I always see those kinds of portals with 6-7 people on them. Idk how it is in masters and GM as I’m not that high (hopefully will get there) but at least as I’ve been ranking up people still always go for those portals. \n\nAnother small factor in probably just the lack of solid 1-2 cost units making rolling early feel like crap. While there’s a few, there’s not enough to warrant going for it. Plus an early 1 star 4 cost is honestly a bit too powerful imo with how many 2 star lower units it can plow through."

If you want to deny that then be my guest - again, glasses better be hella cheap.    \nAnd it's not really hard to get why that happened, in fact, you said it yourself, in a roundabout way: You could force the comp. Because it was both immensely flexible and immensely consistent. No necessary augments, no necessary 3*, flexible secondary carry, somewhat flexible frontline. \n\nBut yeah, keep your insults, your projections, your misunderstandings and your denial of reality, if you must.

Plenty of comps were just as viable. I could go down the list of comps that were strong that set.\n\nThere was far more variety than the BS in Set 11.\n\nAny set you’re gonna have a meta comp but they rotated throughout the set and the other comps were still viable. \n\nPunk Rapidfire, Country Samira, Ahri Sentinels, KDA Akali/Ahri, EDM Jax with Moshers, Emo/Spellweaver Annie, Jazz was an extremely flexible trait, Pentakill Karthus with Akali. True Damage had reroll Yasuo/Senna transitioning into Akali/Qiyana. Even Disco/Dazzler had strong carries and frontline. Crowd Divers would shit on Ezreal hard too.\n\nTheres so many comps that were viable in Set 10 especially when they barely made changes towards the last 1-2 months of Set 10 because they hit a sweet spot in the balancing. I just went with whatever the game gave me and enjoyed it for what it was. \n\nNot looking at it with rose tinted glasses. I played a shit ton of Set 10 and would grind it everyday till Set 11 came out. It was fun and it wasn’t frustrating like it is seeing the same BS Trickshot comps or a Gnar/Kindred forcer with 2 cost Gnar having 500 AD. \n\nEvery comp being a variation of Dragonlord or Heavenly is more annoying than an AD flex Ezreal player. Like no shit you can play Ezreal with other units when Heartsteel has each unit having an EdgeLord/Crowd Diver, or a Rapidfire. Kayn is also literally a heartsteel and edgelord so you complaining about “Ezreal with X Unit” is a terrible argument.\n\nActing like people don’t play Heavenly with some sort of AD flex unit like Kayn, Leesin with Wukong this set. Or 4 Dragonlord with an Irelia or other legendary units like Hwei/Azir. \n\nYou’re the one that insulted first with the sarcastic ass “variety” comment when there was variety. Just saying. Im living in reality and the reality is Set 11 is dogshit."

    {
      "comment_body": "So, before going over everything you said, in detail, I'm just gonna get this out of the way: None of what you said contradicts the fact that Ezreal AD Flex was the meta-defining comp for about 1.5 months.\n\nNow:\n\n>I’m living in reality right now and Ezreal was not as bad as you think. He’s gotta cast three times before he does his AOE there’s plenty of time for your backline to roll through the frontline and at best he might get 1-2 big casts off.\n\nA champion is not a comp. Ezreal was not the problem, as previously stated, the flexibility and reliability of the comp was what made it strong. Ezreal was just the best supporting AD carry.\n\n>There was far more variety than the BS in Set 11.\n\n>Any set you’re gonna have a meta comp but they rotated throughout the set and the other comps were still viable.\n\nThese two statements are somewhat contradictory. The meta comps througout Set 11 have already rotated, and we are only about halfway through it. There are s till quite a few patches yet to come.  \nBard, Yone, Duelists, Aphelios, KogMaw, Senna Ghostly - there were widely different Meta comps before the current patch. And, unlike the given Ezreal comp, there were usually 2-3 comps a patch, like right now, which could be considered meta. The viability of other comps is somewhat subjective, and definitely sucks ass in the current patch, but statistically it's been fine for a few patches before this.\n\n>Punk Rapidfire \\[...\\]\n\nI'm not gonna repeat my previous definition of \"meta\" again. Yes, Ezreal was beatable, but Master+ lobbies had 3 or more people running Ezreal comps every single game - I can assure you that there was a reason for that.\n\n>\\[...\\] It was fun and it wasn’t frustrating \\[...\\]\n\nThis is your subjective opinion, and you are entiteled to that. It's no reason or justification for denying reality, though - that's what my rose tinted glasses comment was all about.\n\n>Every comp being a variation of Dragonlord or Heavenly \\[...\\] Kayn is also literally a heartsteel and edgelord so you complaining about “Ezreal with X Unit” is a terrible argument.\n\nYes, that is how traits work. The flexibility of Heartsteel stemmed from the amount of open synergies the trait offered. I can literally reverse this sentence by swapping the traits and units around, and it works about as well.  \nI also want to point out that the thing I am criticizing is not the comp in question, or even the meta, but the fact that people's perceptions of stale metas are subject to a lot of revisionism. Ezreal was fine overall, I liked Set 10 well enough. I just hate that people always get hung up at \"current thing bad, last thing good\" in frustrating situations with no factual basis.\n\n>Acting like people don’t play Heavenly with some sort of AD flex unit like Kayn, Leesin with Wukong this set. Or 4 Dragonlord with an Irelia or other legendary units like Hwei/Azir.\n\nAgain, show me where I did anything like that. I feel like you just read into this what you want to, instead of reading what was there.\n\n>You’re the one that insulted first with the sarcastic ass “variety” comment when there was variety.\n\nAh yes. A sarcastic statement about a general community sentiment, not directed at anyone in particular, is perfectly comparable to direct personal insults. lmao, mate.\n\n>Im living in reality and the reality is Set 11 is dogshit.\n\nSure, if that's what you think, have fun with not having fun. I'm playing in moderation, I'm hoping for improvements with the next patches and looking forward to the new artifacts and other spicy general changes. But that's just me, you can be completely different without being wrong about that - your feelings are reality. Not objective fact, though."

Even with Riot buffing them in the recent patch they still are beatable, just yesterday I beat a 3* Kayn with a standard porcelain board and and beat a 3* Kaisa with Gnar reroll so I'd go as far as to say that denying isn't as important this set as previous sets.set's.

For example, knowing how to position to save HP, managing your item economy, knowing what to slam and what to greed, knowing when to hold pairs vs when to make econ, knowing what your strongest board is early/mid game, knowing when to level.\n\nWhen people say that low elo has no idea what they're doing, they're not talking about them being unable to netdeck S-tier comps. But rather, they struggle to get to the end boards.\n\n(Through they're generally 3-5 days behind on the meta read. I doubt low elo has Sylas players for example)."

Any inferior deck & character be can made up for by skill & execution to allow you to beat another player in a 1v1 even if they have a statistically superior deck / character. This isn't the case in TFT i suppose, as long as you reach certain boards, boards of a lower tier will tend to \"lose\" on average.\n\nI think most replies' focus is that any high elo player can top 4 in every single game in lower elo even without netboarding which is true.\n\nIn TFT you don't get the opportunity to 'outplay' other players very much, especially since it's not of a 1v1 nature. Other players can take advantage of the 6 other players in game i suppose.\n\nBut OP there is definitely execution in TFT. I think most of it can be seen in top 4 % rather than win %. Tempo comps that only help you top 4 exist. Also, I have no basis since I don't play card or fighting games, but I don't think playing TFT helps you improve nearly as much as in those games. You improve much more from studying than playing and I'm not just talking about end-boards.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure about other games but TFT as a game is pretty complex. Idk how to put this but the difference between challenger players and master players is probably much bigger than the difference between diamond & silver players. I'm not kidding. Just check ladder, there are 1000+ LP players with less than 200 games, some 150."

A better player takes better augments/econs/plays stronger early boards to be healthier + get more gold etc. \n\nTFT isn't a simulator where they can always build the board from a preset list, they still have to make it and you can easily get there first or play a better comp via your advantages you build if you were actually better. Blaming it on high elo trickling down the good comps is an attempt to move the buck off you.\n\nNow if your argument is that \"i can't play my garbage umbral alune reroll(example comp) because everyone copies good boards from high elo \".... that isn't power creep.

No one in challenger plays super off meta regularly and is successful unless they get perfect items/augments. \n\nYou could easily get to diamond playing whatever garbage you wanted with solid fundamentals and an understanding of how the units/traits function.\n\nThe biggest struggle for low elo is a lack of game knowledge and adapting to what they hit. They go to whatever website and plug in whatever successful comp and call it a day. High elo does not play those m exact comps every game. For example, ashe. I think the common boards on those sites is either 4 invoker ashe with mythic or 4 warden with 4 arcanist. But you can combine the two or add play behemoth frontline with udyr/ornn.

If they hit will you beat them? No probably not, but you could easily get a top 4 under them by beating everyone else and conserving enough hp that the others bleed out before you.\n\nRight now i could exclusively play shenna/janna flex on a new TFT account and climb too.

People are gonna look but what is the best comp right now and yes it will help them get there for certain BUT how you econ when you level, roll slam items which augments to picks and scouting to dodge people contesting your line or positioning is SOOOOO mich more important than playing comp XYZ because it is S-Tier. \n\nEvery comp in the right circumstances can top 4 maybe not top 1 but for certain top 4.\n\nThere is a reason why not everyone is Challenger.

I mean ultimately your argument is that there’s some power creep that is happening because low elo players understand meta comps because they watch streamers now. And that the knowledge of meta comps is a large part of skill expression in this game. \n\nNews flash. Net decking meta comps have been around since the very beginning of tft and it has existed in every elo and every patch. And bad players stay bad and good players stay good. There is so much more to tft than you’re implying and so much skill expression that still exists even in a constrained meta that you’re missing. And so that’s why a good player can play a non meta comps in low elo and still easily climb even if every single other player in those lobbies is playing meta. Yes you’re not controlling the units and so there is less “technical” skill but there’s so much that goes into stuff like econ, scouting, transitions, positioning, item economy, etc etc I could go on\n\nAll of that forms the fundamentals of tft and the the fundamentals of low elo players suck and they love to bitch about how X meta sucks because there’s only X meta comps when there is so much more to tft skill expression than “knowing the meta.” And if you feel like you can’t climb out of low elo unless you play meta then it’s probably a skill issue as I guarantee any top player could beat lower elo players with the strength of their fundamentals alone while playing some gimmicky home brew tier F comp.\n\nMy sense is that you are upset that you can’t play weird non meta comps at the highest level and succeed like in mtg or something (even tho tournament mtg is literally just a net deck fest due to need for consistency vs just cheesing your opponent online with some dumb gimmick). Mtg is a far more open and unsolved game than tft (just think abt the number of mtg cards in any given format vs tft units) and many more viable alternative win cons. So yes. Tft is a more inflexible game than mtg and other less solved games. But there is absolutely no more power creep than existed in the past and knowing what units go into X meta comps is like… 1% of what you need to succeed at top level tft. And in both the highest level is…. a net deck fest - but in both, a ton of skill expression still exists even if you are playing the exact 75 card deck as your opponent or in a stale tft meta that I think you completely fail to appreciate"

      "comment_body": "> which is why challenger is such a tiny percentage of players rather than a permanently growing percentage.\n\nI think you just don't understand how the game works, because you do realize that there is a preset number of slots on every server right? The top rank isn't \">2500 elo\" or whatever the internal metric is its straight up \"top 200 on the server\". It is always the same amount, just server dependent on how big challenger can be.  Challenger fundamentally can't keep growing because it is hard locked at the amount of slots based on server population.\n\nMaster and GM **are** always growing, gm less so because players hit that masters wall and can't climb but the masters alone gets a fuckton of people as the set goes on. Theres a reason people shittalk masters 0lp players as fake masters - they lucked into it from a streak in diamond and can't climb."

I played Dota Underlords for 2\\~3 years and the game was leagues below TFT in complexity. 1 item per hero, less global items (augments), set rotations were much more plain and simple etc. the result is: to this day, you can play almost anything you want as long as you tick certain boxes (and there are even fewer boxes to tick when comparing to tft). of course, in higher elo lobbies you'll get a more homogeneous playing field, but that ties back to what I said above: when you need that extra edge, you'll go to the more sure-fire comps, since we talking about rng.\n\nadd in the data heavy reality + competitive aspect, two things Underlords never had, and people have little to no reason to try and experiment.\n\nwhy try new things if the result is always a 7th\\~8th place?\n\nalso also, think about every TFT like a loooong poker hand: if you could, you'd only enter hands with AK+, but sometimes you play suited conectors aiming to deceive opponents AND... play the damn hand once in a while.\n\nwhen you introduce so much variance, new possibilities will rise for low value hands to hit something good (or even the nuts). but that will ALSO increase the power of the better hands. why play the damn suited conectors then if you're not Negreanu?"

I wanna have a few fallback comps but play most of the possible combinations if the opportunity presents itself through augments/drops and early highrolls.  He wants to have 1 or 2 really solid non-flex comps that always feel good to play, built up gradually over the game, have a little bit of leeway for how you cap them, and generally perform fine-to-good.\n\nI'll say, I always feel like if you misstep, it's super easy to lose tons of lp, while you can play pretty well and scout and do math and you might just end up with the 3rd-5th strongest capped board.  So, with how punishing coming in last 2 is, it can be hard to justify experimenting over always taking the safe route.  (alternatively though, there would be other problems like inflation, getting stuck in ranks, etc if this wasn't true.  There's gonna be some issues either way when balancing 8 person games)"

Set 7 was the last time I felt like there were a lot of comps I could go for or pivot into, to do well on. On top of the bigger and bigger amounts of uncontrollable RNG you have to deal with. \n\nIt's sadly one of the biggest reasons why I've played less and less of TFT lately, too. I used to play every pbe and then spam games throughout the season, I'm mostly a hyper roll player but the last 3 sets have had me feel like I'm forcing myself to hit hyper tier.

A game with so much randomness, so much creativity, so much complexity, I don't think it's possible for a meta to have most units and most traits be meta. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong.

Most of the other trait augments have a unique synergy with the trait itself (i.e. Storyweaver buffs Kayle, Dryad gives bonus stacks every round, etc.) but Umbral just gives bonus damage, that is reset every time they swap targets. \n\nNot only is this somewhat \"bland\" as an augment, it has anti-synergy with the trait's own units (Yone swaps targets every cast, and  Sett can break targeting of your other units on the enemy's frontline). And that's not even mentioning how this bonus can be nullified by items/units like EON, Galio or any unit with a dash. \n\nThe trait bonus feels a lot more suited for something like Duelists, who just repeatedly attack the same units over and over. \n\nI think something like \"Executing enemies gives your Umbral units bonus damage for the rest of combat\" makes a lot more sense. It doesn't even have to be bonus damage, but at least tie the reward to something that makes logical sense with the trait. \n\nIs this the only problem with Umbral? No. Would it make it more viable as a vertical? Maybe. But I think the current trait augment is bad, which makes the trait vertical undesirable compared to other verticals."

After that I completetly demolished the lobby, full of Kayns, Ashes, Kai'sas, Gnars, etc. I was even contested on the spectral front because of the Gnar build). I completed this comp with a Sett.

With 2 people playing it, hitting 3* Yone should be very difficult so it is even worse. Gnar is good with specific augments and/or +1 Dryad, but otherwise the 4 cost comps are stronger. Gnar is also much weaker when contested since the comp needs Gnar 3* quickly to win fights and farm Dryad stacks. \n\nBard is the worst placing unit in high elo so unless they have an insane spot that should be a free bot 4 for them. Then there is Ethereal Blades which is decent if you have the right items, but it doesn't usually win the lobby. At Diamond+, it has a decent 50.9% top 4 rate but only a 6.9% winrate. In contrast they can just play Ashe with Guinsoo's Rageblade (you should never play Bard or Ethereal Blades without this item anyway) which performs much better."

There are a lot of Units that will either be complete ass or be straight up broken.\n\n Lillia for example. It takes 2 casts that are mostly useless rn and then she gets a big one. I really don't know how you could make it that her 1st and 2nd cast become relevant cause if you do shes gonna be broken cause she just instanly snipes ur backline.\n\nMorgana is just straight up hit or miss. You cant give her aim at most Units cause you would need to lower her damage so much she would be too weak again and the random cast also sucks cause if she keeps ulting single Units or the unkillable Tank she sucks too. \n\nI dont think we have to talk about Lissandra her ult screams broken or useless. \n\nTrickshot is one of the Traits that are mostly impossible to Balance cause of the Design i think. With Trickshots you have to make a Unit with very good Single Target and to enable the Unit you have to use the Trait to make it viable. We saw it with Bard now being ass and after 2 nerfs to Kaisa she is still way too strong imo. You would have to nerf her again but then shes probably be ass too. \n\nOne big Problem I always had with TFT is the difference between AD and AP. Imo it needs a rework  cause rn the problem anything that uses AD be it Caster or Auto Attacker they will always use all the Stats Items Provide both on ults and basic attacks. AP on the other Hand only use it on Casts and a lot of times by the the Time both Units Cast the AD Unit will always Deal more damage only cause Basic Attacks actually Deal Damage. AP Units always need to Invest in at least 1 Mana Item cause otherwise they are complete ass cause it takes so long to cast and basic attacks Deal no damage. Kaisa for example which is AD Caster doesnt have to cause even if she takes longer to cast shes still gonna Deal damage with Basic Attacks. \n\nOne thing they could do is adding a Portion of AP into Basic Attack Damage.

I think after the level 7 and level 8 rolldown approaches were developed and adopted, the strategy and skill became more about luck as everyone moved at the same time and just hoped to be the guy that got lucky.  Now, with players having meta-awareness of that approach, skill expression is about evaluating your board state, getting incremental gains and managing hp loss more tightly, and deciding if you can risk rolling at the same time or if you need to spend more to go early or save more and go harder late.\n\nAs game skill increases at the high end, constraints have to become tighter to separate highly skilled players.  The sieve becomes finer to pass only the finest grains.  Part of that is bag size (do more work with tighter tolerances), increased levels (spend more on levels, build more complex boards), and streak gold (streak to 6 for max value now, not 5).  There are also a lot more resources than there used to be, in part to offset some of those changes, and we're still seeing 3* 4 costs reliably in too many games.  So the tolerances are still a little wide and the sieve needs to tighten (probably bag odds.)\n\nBasically, the bag size is still fine; the optimization goals have moved and you have to adapt to that."

Hell go to the competitive tft subreddit and theres even posts about people one tricking gnar and memeing about how tft players have so many options to choose from and just stick to one broken comp. It baffles me anyone could possibly argue gnar is weak.\n\nSenna is also up there, but playrate isnt as high, and stats arent that high either so if you wanna argue about her not being that broken, sure.\n\nBut gnar is there virtually every game at lvl 7 destroying lvl 9 boards both in solo q AND in tournament, where people generally have stronger boards, a lvl 7 gnar board is still somehow beating lvl 9 boards, this isnt a \"oh in tourney they hit faster so they go 9 and buy high level units thats why gnar is good\" no the gnar players were sitting at lvl 7 beating lvl 9 boards, thats how broken gnar is.\n\nMind you, if you look at stats for plat+ emerald+ then suddenly gnar falls down a few tiers, im assuming that is the reason why people seem to think gnar is somehow weak, because the majority of players are below even that which i assume looking at that trend gnar is even weaker in gold silver, where most players are."

If we take a look at some of the most popular sets of all time, they were horrifically unbalanced and if we take a look at probably the most balanced set of all time, it had one of the steepest drop offs in playerbase we've ever seen.\n\nSet 4, Set 3, Set 4.5 and set 3.5 were probably Riots most successful pre augment sets, and set 6, 9 and 10 are their most successful post augment sets.\n\nWhat do they have in common? All of them brought a huge disparity in balancing. Set 4 had some ungodly balancing problems that people sweep under the rug(ahri GA, aphelios, cultist etc), set 3 and 3.5 had literally ONE COMP patches, patches where only one comp could succeed, same with 4 and 4.5. remember warweek? Yeah... \n\nThen you take a look at their most balanced set which is 5.5, now that shit was about as closed to a perfectly balanced set we've ever seen, and people left in DROVES. Returning when set 6 and it's own balancing nightmare fuel came around.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that balanced is not fun and doesn't increase playability AT ALL, what causes people to play is replayability and having something to chase, yknow like the real broken shit? That's what people want. \n\nYou can lie that people want to come in and play well, top 4 and climb but that simply is not true for everyone, and sure the ladder warriors like this shit, but the average person? Not so much. The average person knows they ain't gonna get above gold, plat or w.e, so they want to chase shit that's broken to feel good...\n\nAnyway, don't take for granted that although we have a 4 cost meta, at least there's still fast 9 available, at least there's still some situationally competitive reroll comps(Janna, Zyra etc) because we've had patches in the past where this isn't the case"

If it's just because they're holding stronger boards and evaluating the lobby really well to minimize their hp losses, more aggressive early builds aren't going to alter that too much.\n\nBasically, are we dealing with a reprise of the Draven or ASol legends era, where everyone choosing the same strat makes it MORE optimal?  And thus, people shaking up the groupthink could break the stalemate?  Or is it just a consequence of very high performance play, rather than groupthink?"

Basically if you can just piece together a few one star 4 costs and get one of them two starred you’re going to shit on every single “aggro” board. That’s why full open (literally playing zero units for the entirety of stage 2) is a viable strategy right now as Econ matters SOOO much and player damage got nerfed. If you can’t level to 8 on 4-2 and roll you’re just fucked as all the 4 costs have been taken out of the pool. \n\nIt’s not groupthink, it’s just that overly playing for early game is just a very very suboptimal strategy way of playing the game right now given how player damage / unit power balancing is right now. One strategy (fast 8) is so dominant, OP, and uncounterable that everything else is crowded out."

High elo players aren’t spamming the same contested strategy because they want to - in fact they probably are able to flex into way more strategies than the avg player\n\nBut yeah - they need to tune it so stuff like reroll can be viable again"

Every single person in the lobby plays for one of these depending on their items and augments, and its just a lottery of who hits first/more because everyone is rolling on the same round. Lvl 7 reroll is too garbage, except for Fated, to be able to win against stage 4 comps and if you try to go 9 and skip rolling on 8, you're killing 1-2 units per fight and dying very fast.\n\nI hate this meta, everyone plays the same because they're forced to."

It's not a superior meta, it's just a different one, and frankly, econ meta takes more skill - if 2 out of eight players are getting to it each game, that means six aren't, so wheat getting swept from chaff there.  If we had stronger verticals, it would be THIS SAME COMPLAINT but it would be \"every game there's one Inkshadow, one Mythic, one Heavenly, one Fated, one Storyweaver, one Umbral, one Duelists, and one guy who also went Storyweaver and lost.  Whoever gets the most spats wins, garbage balance rito buff low synergies so we can have soup comps.\"  \n\nWhen 3 costs are strongest, we have a reroll 7 meta.\nWhen 4 costs, fast 8.\nWhen 5 costs, fast 9.\nBecause of the nature of pool-based gameplay, these all get better the more people follow them.  Legendary soup is probably the best possible single state - it means the most expensive units are the most cost-efficient ones and the game won't stall on an earlier phase.  If they get the balance close enough, midrange reroll 7 comps can compete with fast 9s by bleeding them earlier."

But that Dryad player has been quietly accumulating stacks all game - he's got multiple 3-star tanks with over 1k extra hp, effectively about six Warmogs.  Meanwhile OP has Storyweavers 7, all the power of which is very visible on the board (Kayle).  That's where the disconnect between reading the board and seeing the outcomes is (for that matchup.)  OP also has multiple 2\\* 1-cost units, which add effectively nothing to his board; Dryad doesn't have that problem.  All the units (except Yone) are big beef.  \n\nSimilar problem with Mythic; Mythic 10 adds a huge amount of beef but it's not really visible in a post-game screen.  Also, like, prismatic trait gonna prismatic.  I can't argue with the issue with the top comp; I dunno if this is the endgame score or if Porcelain was just in the lead when OP died (but guessing the latter based on elapsed time.)

Maybe tweak the risk/reward factor of them because the optimal strategy for Fortune (when you don't have an emblem) seems to be 'go walk your dog' because its SO punishing to lose your streak that trying to save HP isn't really worth it. It also a baffling decision that you only need 2 emblems and level 7 and a 4 cost unit to pretty much guarantee a win when you have other traits that need 3 emblems and level 10 with and a 5 cost unit to STILL have less power than the Fortune 7."

For example, if you have Malphite, Darius, and qiyana, you should also hold a rek sai pair if you have it, since playing a reksai 2 is stronger than any heavenly or umbral 1 starred. \n\nPersonally, I play the storyweaver opener in probably 90% of my games because it can use any items, and there are a lot of units to add to the core of riven, Garen, sivir.\n\nDon’t listen to that other guy. Do not hold kog maw or Cho unless it’s the only thing you can hold or you’re playing kog maw reroll. Even if you 2* Caitlyn, kog, malph, and Cho, you will probably lose to a 2* Darius with heavenly umbral, and you will have no money for the rest of the game."

Traits this Set are not really strong especially early, so early 2 stars are more important imo.\n\nDon't know if you use any tools but metatft has a list of strong openers.

Also Thresh buffs her because she's the lowest hp I guess? I dunno.\n\n  \nEdit: I get it now.

At least this is an explanation I've heard.\n\nSo what's probably happening is that your Kayne is just getting teapotted every flight, and by the time he gets out, your weak frontline is gone and Kayne will be the next to die ( if he even survived the Liss ability)"

It should just be largest clump with a hard cooldown of 6 seconds between each clump.\n\n(They can code this in btw, Lissandra, a single target unit, has a hard 14 second cooldown on casting her spell on a unit that experiences a GA proc during the spell or a unit like Ornn who goes unstoppable during his ability) \n\nIt feels absolutely terrible(using last patch as an example) when Morg decides to instead of doing AoE dmg to the Voli duelist board she targets the Tristana who jumps out of the cast or the Irelia in the corner, leaving her Kayn or other carries out to dry.\n\nObviously that example is on the rather extreme side of low rolling, but there’s times where melting the frontline would feel so much better than hitting the backline. This is obviously on a case-to-case basis, but pure randomness on a spell is terrible and far too fight swingy.(I just lose some fights if Morgana decides to not do anything???

Uncontested in 99% of games, b.) Because you can easily hit her at 3 Star in this meta as the 4 Cost pool will be extremely thinned out and it is the only way the unit to not be stuck on a tank for 10+ seconds, and c.)

You need to imagine a good capped out level 9 legendary board, and reverse engineer your way there as fast as possible. Now make sure you pick augments to support that. This usually means at least an econ aug on 2-1, and on 3-2 either another econ or some other Fast 9-friendly aug like Tiny Tacticians. Play strongest board, preserve HP, and never take your eyes off the prize. Unless you high roll into a reroll build, the mistake I see other players in Prismatic lobbies is not being ambitious enough. It is not just, \"Now I can play regular mid-boards with an advantage.\" You will get steam rolled in late Stage 4 onwards by boards who were greedier and bigger in their vision.\n\n\nNow what do you do if you get no econ or \"accelerator\" augs? At this point, you need to lean heavily into combat augs being offered you to make up for econ with board strength. Augments like Tiny But Deadly, Pumping Up, Jeweled Lotus, etc., are super juiced at Prismatic tier. \n\nYou will still need to push levels, even with combat augs, but you're more likely aiming for a strong level 8 board to survive Stage 5 and won't be going level 9 until Stage 6+ unless you're really lucky on your 4-2 rolldown. \n\nThis was already longer than intended and I could probably ramble for a couple more paragraphs.

Either way, seemed pretty fair.\n\n2* 4 costs were strong enough to carry with BiS and headliner bonus. \n\n3* 3 costs generally didn't feel totally overwhelming or useless. I miss you, Lux giga-laser.\n\n3* 1/2 costs (generally) felt like they had a reasonable power curve. Weak very early, spike hard in early-mid, then taper off if you can't transition into a late-game board. Punk, however, can go fuck itself. Punk was fine when it was mediocre. 1/2 costs should never be hyper carries under any circumstances imo.\n\nComps felt more rock-paper-scissors, which is something I prefer. Very frustrating when there is a tier-zero comp that is I-hit-I-win.\n\nThe music theme was pretty great. Champion design was clear, in my opinion. Units were interesting and HL allowed riot to add a bit of spice.\n\nThe downsides were with balance rather than fundamental champion design. When ahri-sentinels were OP, it was during the dreaded riot winter break. Not sure if it's because of being stuck on the same patch for a month or if these patches specifically are consistently bad, but my *god* did super yuumi suck ass the year before as well. But that was more of a numbers-thing rather than *and they get a shield and damage and healing and movement speed and a dash and CC and and and and*."

Everyone’s trying to hit the same 2 or 3 things.

No, everyone will hit for free. And if you are in that lobby, playing a 3 cost reroll, it is impossible for you to hit.\n\nSo the bag size encourages metas where a single cost is all that people play. The more people play units of a certain cost, the stronger it becomes. So last patch reroll was dominant, everyone was able to hit easily.

Last set corki/jinx/yasuo/olaf/annie. 2 cost was bard, garen(ap garen), jax, katarina, kayle, senna, seraphie, twitch. This set 2 cost you have gnar, kindred, maybe janna if you get the true damage dragonlord, lux, neeko (needs augment), teemo, and senna (basically dead after ghostly change). So 2 of these require augments to work and things like neeko/kindred are used by like 3 different comps. I could go on for 3 costs etc but yes I think most of the champs are pretty weak in general but in set 10 you have a lotttttt more viable options.\n\nAlso think some of the problem is too many different champs being used in the exact same comps."

For several sets it's seemed way more important to get the meta 4 or 5 cost and put the meta item on them. That's not strategic. That's not about culminating a team, it should just be called 4 Cost Carry Abuse but I understand FCCA or 4CCA doesn't roll off the tongue...\n\n2) What is the point of making so many available traits and shit for only 1-3 to be viable at a time? I feel like I can't even play certain things unless I want a guaranteed bottom 4. \n\nI'm starting to get really frustrated with this. They seem to be copy and pasting the same mistakes and gameplay every set at this point with the only thing setting them apart being the current theme/aesthetic for the set, the new RNG shit they've done to bag size and what have you, the augments, and just constant overtuned buffs and nerfs. I wish they could reach a middle ground where the game is somewhat balanced and consistently playable. An almost laissez-faire style of balance, if you will, but right now they seem to be so hands-on with the game experience but it's never a good one 🫠 Whoever gets the current OP meta bullshit wins, imo. Maybe you can squeak by in top 4 if you get lucky, but again, I feel like first place is dictated by how gets luckiest and I wish the game wasn't so dictated by RNG it feels pointless to try to strategize as a player with how much they fuck with the game and launch it with only, again, 1-3 viable comps."

For example Hwei can attack the backline, but if the enemy has any kind of healing augment or items, then they just heal back.\n\nAnd lack of good AOE CC and not Nautilus missing half a team and not stunning whats important. Annie is good. Its a small stun, but it hit directly what annie attacks that means you can stun kayn.\n\nInkshadow stun is also neat and with volibear together its also a double stun.\n\nThen there is Lux with adecent stun. And Lissandra but that also only single target.\n\nThose two things together are a bit of a problem. One makes Kayn strong and the other one makes Ashe strong.\n\nWhat you need is a meta where you can rewroll and where you can fast 8 if both works then its good. If mostly one works it sucks. This Patch ight be a bit unbalanced with Kayn and ashe, but when you nerf them a bit then you have a decent meta.\n\nBleeding Health? If that is youre issue thats mostly a skill issue. Sorry to say that but making a strong team throughout the game is pretty much skill dependent. What you use as an item holder, what units you put in to later swap out for others etc.  \nDont go Vertical, especially early and in mid game use what the shop gives you. If you get a 2\\* amumu use it. You can sell later. If you get a 2\\* 1 cost go use it for some time. Throw items on it that you know are good.

Something like yone however is going to require a bit of a redesign as if he is weak he does nothing but if he is strong he one shots the backline before than can dps him at all. the 4 cost buffs themselves only helped by making frontline stronger. The reason ashe is able to be played now is due to that and the fact that she naturally caps with the strongest unit in the game in Lissandra. Lilia, morg, and syndra are all rather mid still. \n\nThey were likely a bit heavy handed with the 3 cost nerfs as they had literally been dominating every patch of the set so far. if they didn't do enough and they had just been the best thing this patch as well player engagement would have dropped significantly.

You want to invest in more tank items than damage to reach late game, and you want to prioritize dupes on characters like Galio. I always try to get a Nautilus or Sett in the frontline as early as I can as well. If you buy Kayle enough time, she will do plenty of damage. (Just get her an Ionic Spark or a Static Shiv)"

I usually play to climb to Master tier and have 700-1000 hours into the game, and I played this one to try out the set.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was fun overall. The visuals were appealing on the portal selection. I was slightly annoyed that my portal wasn't picked, but it wasn't that bad since it was Crab Rave (I was basically new, so I didn't want to die to the crab after not knowing how to save hp). I started the game basically without knowing what the units did, so I had to read everything and come up with a comp. Learning something was somewhat entertaining, and watching the units do things was fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEncounters were a nice addition. The aesthetics made me feel good, and the random nature of what they did was something to look forward to. I forgot mostly what the encounters did, but we did get an Artifact encounter and I got Manazane. I ended up putting it on Lissandra 2 to farm many items, and before that I had a Remover and was able to transfer it from Ornn (temp items) to Lissandra. Farming is fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAugments were okay. Getting gold from Gambler's Blade was fun, but I didn't see any other fun augments after getting the encounter that let you roll twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nItems felt like enhancers that allowed me to build up a complete character, so good overall. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI played Fortune for many rounds without any streak. Tbh it didn't feel fun without lose streak I guess. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't see many good comps since it was only 1 extra low mmr norm. I just played Teemo 2 carry with Manazane Ornn and some random adcs until big crab (survived with 2 hp and 3 people who were stronger than me died). Then I rolled down for 5 costs and came 1st. All of the 5 cost units are fun and exciting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe game lasted for 40 mins, and although I would say it's good for 1 game, I don't see how that is good for multiple games in a row. It would feel like I'm losing time. This is how I feel since the games or sessions that I normally play last 15 mins or less. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy takeaway from this experience is that TFT is fun for new players, and I would rather play casually than to climb ranks. Also, I think it's fun when you have leeway to hit upgrades and everything without dying (at least playing the final comp for a few rounds or farming items). It would have been sad for me to die to Crab Rave without realizing my full potential, or dying after not upgrading contested 5 costs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Remember that mythic suffer a huge lack of dmg so its important to have red buff or morello on the whole board with lillia wei because if u dont get enough offensive stats, u can get advantage on the bonus hp and get atleast a consistent % dmg and prevent enemy sustain.   Small tip from a random guy: every fight watch the dmg of your units, if a unit with offensive items deal less than a tank unit u have a problem (bard). I mean u can play it if u like him that much, but u need 4 trickshot so even if the dps is low, u annihilite the backline before the frontline."

If they die before they ult they may as well be any other unit. 10 SW Kayle is really strong. Strong enough to wipe a board before they cast. Lissandra needs I think 60/70 mana for her first cast. That's already 6 autos, kayle easily wipes before that happens. Wukong ult is only 20 mana, but takes a while to kill an entire board because it just goes around smacking different parts. Kayle can easily kill him before he kills her. He's still on the board and she has massive aoe. Hwei, again like lissandra needs a lot of mana to cast, if he casts nice you likely win. Kayle does more damage before the cast goes off. This fight comes down to itemization. You either need enough starting mana on liss for her to ult instantly, or and edge of night or zonyahs on any of the 5 costs to have them live long enough to cast and kill."

Positioning was really important due to zephyr & shroud, QSS mattered, RFC made carries out of melee units who would otherwise struggle to carry… we had mana printers & infinite casting units. \nI’m not saying all of this was healthy for the game but it was certainly interesting & entertaining & definitely made the game more interactive, especially in regards to item slots on champs more competitive instead of just slamming whatever generic item gives the most cohesive stat blocks. I just reviewed all the current items & almost all of them say “do more damage when X”, “reduce damage from Y”, “gain Z stats”. It’s just boring. Artifacts are ok, I’m sure the new artifacts will help a bit, but I just hope it’s enough of a shake up to make the game more interactive. I also worry about the cost of taking or acquiring the artifacts. Like if someone is just going to stat check me by building generic items & taking combat augments/econ augments, is it ever even worth it to try & have a more dynamic or interesting game? Time will tell I guess",

QSS in this iteration actually stronger with extra ramping atk speed, y all just not build it and wonder why Lissandra is giga broken against melee.\n\nAll other items has same issue, you warp unit designed for item so much that you cannot play a comp without that item, it reduces flexibility and always feels bad when you hit the unit but does not have that specific item\n\nFurthermore you look at the high end but forgot the low end. Example, previously early start of Cloak + Belt means you have to play lose streak, cus build a Zephyr is just dogshit early with no help whatsoever, but in late game every body swarming to build/get Zephyr, same with other support items like Zeke, Banshee, Chalice. Now you can slam Cloak Belt for Evenshroud and play AD unit early instead of forced to lose streak early\n\nThat just trade off boring for balance"

All of the comps feel completely solved and every game I'm in just boils down to the Lissandra sweepstakes + whoever hits a 3\\* 4 cost. At least last patch, despite Yone being overplayed, I felt like there was an element of counterplay available to me at any given moment. This patch however I feel extremely little agency especially against all these 3\\* 4 costs (which I genuinely see happen almost every game somehow). I'm a mid diamond player and on this current patch I don't even feel like I really did anything when I win (except maybe on Kayn encounter).\n\nI'm not a game designer, nor some type of tft balance expert, and I'm aware the balance team gets a totally unjustified amount of hate. That being said this one patch in particular has truly sucked the fun out of the game entirely for me. I just hope I'm not alone in finding this patch particularly terrible. If I am though and this is what people like then I guess I'm just SOL.\n\nHope next patch encourages way more versatility.",

Only way to beat that comp is to go fortune with huge payout. You try to flex into any comp for \"fun\". You are snuffed out.\n\n\nI am not enjoying the 4-2 roll down and if you don't hit you lose.

Last patch had at least a bunch of different reroll comps at lvl 6 and 7 and you could go lvl 8 for Kaisa. Ashe's was a needed buff, but apart from that this patch has been the most boring one so far. The % nerf to 3 costs on lvl 7 has killed Aphelios reroll (and obvious Yone is dead too), Umbral was already dead from before and Ghost reroll got nerfed earlier too so that has a wooping winrate of 5% now. Gnar is the only reroll you can go on 6 and that depends on if you hit it fast enough to get the mega contested Kayn at 8 or you will will at most get top 4-5 even with good augments."

Thankfully we only have a month left before the next set so there is that. It would have been massively boring if we had to wait 2 more months were this the old schedule for TFT sets.\n\nI normally focus on playing flex but that's been wildly inconsistent for me since I'll have a game with a solid board one match and completely get stompped the next match despite not really knowing why."

    {
      "comment_body": "As a returning player who came back last patch and used to be high rank I agree. Got bow rod and components to a tank item? You’re Ashe/Kaisa depending on your stage 4 rolldown. Got a GA/HOJ?  Slap that shit on Darius and go afk till stage 4 bc you’re  Kayn. These are all decisions made the first stage. At this point even if i hit a board that can streak early i’m still going to take xp/econ augments instead of combat so i have more gold on my 4-1 rolldown and can hit my 4/5 costs first. \n\nI really think last patch was a massive mistake. The changes to 3 cost odds feels so hamfisted and the buffs to 4 costs were overdone. Yes, 4 costs felt weak, especially ashe and to a slight extent kayn, but the devs hit us with the riot special nerfing reroll and buffing 4 costs in the same patch. I think the buffed 4 cost comps could have contested the 3 cost carries if those were the only changes made and it’s not like those comps came online truly before stage 4 unless you highroll. \n\nThe only reroll comp that i’ve seen win is Janna with an insane start. I see the stats and what people say about Gnar but i’m sorry that unit and comp is hot garbage. Yes you can streak if you hit early but if you miss your rolldown you’re playing a suboptimal carry that gets run over by the top 4 cost carry comps and i’ve personally yet to see it even top 4 this patch.\n\nLastly Lissandra. What the fuck is this unit??? She fits into every lvl 8/9 board regardless of synergies. Not only does she cc your 3 star tank (or kayn) instantly but she also YEETS it into your backline so your carries are exposed. I’ve had a fully itemized tank 3-4k HP die inside the stun without casting SO many times it’s infuriating. This isnt even mentioning how she prints you items, like what the fuck? 100% agree with you that this patch is the lissandra slot machine, it’s so bad."

Kog/Cho, Ahri/Yas, Kha'zix, Darius/Yasuo duelist Cait/Senna, Dryad Kindred/Gnar, Senna/Gnar, Senna Ghostly, Janna/Diana, Lux/amumu, hell even kobuko was considered busted just to name a few. 3 cost were stronger and that should be the case. You can play many verticle comp and that was good. Reroll comps shouldnt be optimal, but it should feel satisfy when hit all conditions. \nSure 4 cost were garbage then but you can just buff each unit separately and go from there instead of gutting most reroll comps and swing the meta each patch. \n\n\nThe skill expressions part of being flex player is a lie if all games only center around certain unit right? "

I can go 3 games in a row top 2 because of luck and then 4 games in a row 7/8th just because I get shit items and bad rng.\n\nDoesn't help that the stages are STILL bugged out. every few games you will be locked to your battlefield while the carrousel is invisible, and every other stage will be bugged as well.\n\nIn general the balance is shit, many units are useless because they barely get 1 spell off before they instantly get nuked by something like a Yone that is near unkillable."

There's the occasional Gnar/kindred reroll but that's all I'm seeing. It could be because I'm in emerald, but it's really frustrating. I like the theme, but I am not enjoying this set at all. It seems that every patch streamers/guide makers say what's OP and everyone is hard forcing it. First it was Bard, then Yone and Senna and Gnar, now it's dragonlord and fast 9 and Kayn. Maybe the heavenly and ghostly changes will help but I'm gonna stop playing for a while cause this set isn't fun and hasn't been fun for me for a while"

Lissandra and set 10 Qiyana like units providing you with Gold value through either raw gold or item economy makes the game's state unhealthy to the point of \"if you high rolled Lissandra, you probably get top 4\". I understand the complaints about meta diversity and certain units being way too strong currently, and usually that doesnt dissuade me from playing a patch, but it legit frustrates me when units like Lissandra are in overtuned spots, it makes the game very one dimensional\n\nAlso the whole \"most reroll comps are dead (as Dishsoap put it being B tier at best not including Gnar)\" thing frustrates me, but that's only because I prefer reroll comps to fast 8/9 comps, and that's more of a minor complaint"

Liss easily counters Kayn decks but Ornn and Galio being CC immune while casting skill kinda makes Liss useless.\n\nSo while this meta is extremely fixed down, i think its more disparaging between skilled players and non skilled players.\n\nAlso thanks to the meta, fast 9 decks are making a steady comeback so maybe thats a plus?"

That was never different.  \nWell there were some cases like Lawnmower graves or dragonmancer Nunu that was thinking out of the box and then became meta. And got patched. But TFT was always playing meta. Playing out of the box barely worked at all.  \nDont get me wrong this set is shit, but thats a design issue. Not particularly this patch.  \nLast Patch (before b patch) was way way worse. And teh Yone Patch before that wasnt that much better. Now you actually have strong 4 cost units not trait bots. Now making a stronger Team requires more skill than rerolling for your units.  \nNow managing economy, knowing when to level, getting to lv 8/9 with high hp that requires some skill and flexibility. That means using a strong unit and slamming items on it and later selling that and distributing those items to a unit that is stronger. That cxan mean playing a 2\\* darius together with heavenly and later selling that darius to a 2\\* yone until you have kayn.\n\nIts not liek reroll doesnt work. Its not overwhelmingly dominant as before. You need a mix between fasat 8/9 and reroll and maybe sth in between. If one is to dominant its an issue. Haevenly is to strong and annie is to strong. Ashe isnt so strong tbh. the issue there is the frontline tankiness."

I don't know what it's like going into the game now since i have been playing since set one but to give some insight the best players usually study the meta, they watch videos, and look what comps the top players play, as well as vod review\n\nI think for new players it's best to have really good fundamentals; such as positioning, econ, streaking etc. all good players know how to do these attributes in the game effectively because their fundamentals are so good  \n  \nYou can look up on yt something like tft set 11 patch 14.8 comps or tft beginner guide and follow that, one tricking a comp will work up until like mid plat and then you'll probably need to learn more than one comp, flex will get you more consistent wins since every shop/ game will be different, but if you're new you can always learn to get good at one comp before going to the next"

How do yall expand your range of team comp? Is it by looking at team comp with similar champions?\n\n2. If everyone have the same idea of which team comp to use, what are some things to focus on improving that can make a difference?\n\n3. Which youtuber to watch for improvement or guides as youtube have alot of video jus talking about playing certain team comps that can climb faster?\n\n4.

      "comment_body": "I personally watched Bunnymuffins who makes a lot of guides such as positioning guides and leveling guides, frodan is also a good one to watch.\n\nSince you're in silver you can scout a little less but I like to scout every other stage early, scout during carousel, and then around stage 3/4+i'll scout every round, it's good to scout early to know what's contested or not\n\nif you're talking about in your first question how to find a better cap in your comp it's usually by intuition based off the stage you are in the game; for example in your porcelain ashe comp, say you're running 4 warden but two of your wardens arent upgraded but you find a udyr, you can replace your two shitter wardens with udyr and assuming you have enough gold to roll, you can roll for a ornn for behemoth -- a good way indicator are in general good traits, for porcelain ashe theres many variations, you can fit dlord, invokers, dryad etc.\n\nAs for transitioning; one of the biggest mistakes I think low elo players do is slam items that can't be transitioned into many other comps and w/o scouting. If you slam rageblade you're committing to ashe at stage 2, and the only other unit that likes rageblade is aphelios which aphelios reroll isn't very good right now, or Dlord irelia but that's hard to transition to because you need 9 and a lot of gold to roll down for 2 star 5 cost carry and 2 star 5 cost front line. If you can try not to slam items where you don't have many directions into. I think the best dmg item to slam is last whisper since it can go to kayn, kaisa, or ashe. Best items to slam early are tank items, since all comps can use tank items\n\nUsually you transition your comp based off your items and units you're hitting so if you have components for Kaisa but only have wardens and snipers, but you run into Kaisa at 5 you can hold her, and pick up units that surround kaisa along the way so long as it doesn't hurt your econ and at 4-2 where everyone is 8 and does their rolldown depending if you hit units more for Ashe, or Kaisa you just go into that comp. If you hit kaisa 2 early for example you just commit to Kaisa and give up on ashe, most likely when you climb more ashe will be three way contested so it's easier if you go for another comp that is more likely to not be contested"

Then the augment came and i saw umbral emblem and decide to for once try to pivot to umbral comp. But as the game goes the strongest player was using umbral so i kinda panick as idk how to use umbral comp so i tried to switch back to porcelain and ended up 8th place."

Climbing ranks is a consequence of playing, not a *reason to* play.\n\nBut if you must I think if you just force Morg/Kayn/Sylas/Galio/Riven/Zyra/Aatrox etc. (Yone is a popular choice for Umbral aince you got Sylas, but typically only if Kayn ends up being your carry) You'll be fine. It's not a well known comp on many sites because it isn't played often but mathematically it's the best level 8 comp *on average* that doesn't rely on much variance *and* it uses a variety of 4 costs that aren't typically too contested so you'll usually get top 4 but 1 in about 4 games you'll guarantee top 2 with a 3* 4 cost.\n\nThe *main* core you want to force every game is Riven, Zyra, Galio, Morg, with blue Kayle. After that you can throw together SO many other ideas you'll never be without an uncontested comp.\n\nEventually this comp will catch on and become meta. I only know how busted it is because I actually do the math and study game theory. 99% of the community just waits for people like me to come along and say this stuff and get results with it before they're comfortable agreeing that it's busted. It will eventually be discovered and then balanced.\n\nTl;dr: force this core: Galio, Riven, Zyra, Morg.\n\nAs always this only works if you play best board and slam items. Which is what makes \"forcing\" it awkward."

Don't get too focused on the comp, play with what you get. Got Annie three star for free? Time to field her, for a time at least, no matter your comp is going to be in the future. You need a ton of place holders for your items, and need to know who can carry your items before you find your true carry. Put your items on some of your comp's weaker guy, he will carry for a time, until you sell him and find a replacement 1 star copy of him. Losing all that HP and keeping 2 star copy of him in the field is not worth it."

      "comment_body": "Getting out of Emerald is hard. Getting out of Plat is way easier.\n\nI've climbed to Emerald by mostly do freaky stuffs while sometimes spam meta comps. It's ok to go meta comps if the game gives you good angle even if contested. It's also ok to not onetrick them and aim for top 4 at least with whatever the hell the game gives you good angle of, even if it is very weak in theory. I've made BB Riven bruisers work 2 days ago and got top 1 against some meta boards. The problem is they block their tempo by contesting while you can play your own tempo uncontested if you go your own way and know what you are doing.\n\nSo tldr, learn meta comps now but don't spam them, meta comps help with consistency in good angles but flex is better in the long run."

      "comment_body": "The thing is this comp isnt new. Sage galio with morg and kayn was the most popular lvl 8 comp on the first patch, until people realized rerolling 3 costs was stronger and it got pushed out of the meta. Its natural to infer that with the 3 costs now being pushed back, that this comp would come back in some form, although blue kayle is new, as on 14.1 you would opt for green and sometimes red. Whats notable is it actually did show up on lists of meta comps and had a higher play rate on 14.8 but has dropped since in 14.8b so some peoples intuition on the first patch after 3-costs was gutted did lead them to this comp, but people have since dropped it again after B-patch which is why it doesnt make a blip on the sites that aggregate most popular comps. Robinsongz also lists it on his website as a top comp. \n\nI also suspect the comp has a lower play rate because its not always the final board; if you can hit 9 and your items leaned AD instead of ap for morg (kayn items just go on wukong or even lee), its a relatively easy and natural transition to Dragonlord Irelia, which IS a popular comp and has the highest avg placing of any comp in emerald+ according to metatft. So the comp might be played more in mid-late game but as you approach end game and transition to a higher cap comp, the strongest galio morg comps end up being irelia comps so the data doesnt represent how much the comp is actually played since the game ends with an irelia board. While the weaker ones who couldnt reach for 9 ended up dying on their morg boards, dragging the averages down, but thats just hypothesis and conjecture on my part."

I often pivot out of it myself - didn't realize those sites were just going off of your ultimate endgame comp. I'd figure they look at time/rounds played vs results over that duration.\n\nSo if in a 30 round game, you played that comp from round 10 to 25, then 25 to 30 you pivoted out to better level 9 board, I'd think they'd still list the transitioning com pyou played the bulk of the game with as the actual meta comp.\n\nThanks for the insight!"

      "comment_body": "It may not make sense immediately but I'm a professional poker player. The most comprehensive and easily applicable game theory text I'm aware of is Modern Poker Theory by Michael Acevedo.\n\nI've also played many games like chess, M:tG, and a few other video games over the years on a professional/competitive level. So things that translate from one game to another may bot seem intuitive. For instance TFT is just a drafting card game, a roguelike if you will.\n\nIt may not feel that way, but that's what it is. At its core what TFT really tests is one's ability to manage resources. Just like M:tG. The pretty models, colors, names, all that fluff is just to make it look nice. But really it can boiled down to numbers.\n\nI don't think it's possible for me to write out the math without spending several minutes but it's things like this:\n\nIf you're at level 8 and have ~2 lives left and you need to draft 2 copies of a 4 cost to make 2* and you're 1 round from creeps at 20 gold and you've scouted the lobby and no one has benched copies so you know there are 7 left in the pool, then what is the breakpoint of gold you need to have such that your roll down will guarantee you hit those copies with a 15% standard deviation? Not immediately knowing that number off the top of your head is going to hold you back over a sample size of hundreds of game. Yeah in just one isolated game it's not too relevant. But gaming is about the law of large numbers. If you genuinely believe you're the best then you need to play enough hands (games) to realize your edge. You can do everything perfectly and still lose, that's just math.\n\nSo it's a lot of abstract math based around probabilities. Things like equity. Things like knowing which 4 costs are contested at your elo and how many are in the pool total vs how many you need. Things like having the ultimate flexibility from the very first creep round to pivot at the correct time through scouting.\n\nMy point is focusing on learning the math behind the game and having a solid fundamental intimacy with game theory goes a long way over a large sample of games. Even something like game selection - knowing what time of day better players are on in your elo so you can time your queue better. Soft skills like that go a long way too. It's not *just* math.\n\nThere is no one resource or text about game theory specifically geared to TFT that I know of. But through decades of playing games and making a living playing them at the highest level it all comes together in my head in a way I can't write unless I have a *lot* of time to do so. I wish I had better guidance for you but I think the only answer is time and experience.\n\nThe real secret is enjoying it though. Just play for fun. The moment you stop enjoying it you won't often play well. What keeps.me coming back to studying poker theory and game theory in general is that I'm obsessed. I use games as escapism, an unhealthy form of coping but better than something like drinking.\n\nTl;dr: I don't think anyone has put any books or courses or anything out for TFT specifically. It's just general game theory knowledge from using and applying game theory every day for two decades. It just comes with time. If you want to learn about game theory specifically for TFT you're probably out of luck for now until someone makes a TFT game theory course."

      "comment_body": "I gathered that from how I hardly see it in my games or on sites that list top meta comps.

      "comment_body": "If i had to guess theyre using the api to scrape match history data which will of course only pull end game compsThe reason i think they wouldnt look at rounds played is because 1. Thats a huge amount of data for riot to store instead of just match history so i think riot may actually not have that data available to aggregate and 2. If it went by # of rounds, we would see a lot more transitionary boards on these website comps, especially fortune (or whatever equivalent econ trait a given set has). People tend to play fortune for a ridiculously high number of rounds so if we went by round #s, fortune should show up as a meta comp, but it doesnt. Fortune is a comp that never actually plays fortune units in end game since they always transition, so i think theyre actually represented by irelia, azir, and kaisa comps. And then in metas or sets where certain early/mid game boards are recognized as being really strong or core, we would expect to see them or their units in some meta data as theyd be played in a fairly high # of rounds of the game. Im no expert on APIs though so reason #1 could be totally wrong but i do think reason #2 is potential evidence as id expect a higher fortune representation than what is shown."

At least that site somehow extrpolates that data."

    {
      "comment_body": "U can get all that data from tactics.tools off match history alone. Execution of comps can just compare your average placement of a comp to the avg placement of all players in your rank with that comp. Execution is defined as how well you placed vs the expected placement, so thats simple enough. Flexibility can just be looking at a percent breakdown of the different endgame boards (ie 20% dryad comp, 30% heavenly, etc) you had across all matches vs an average again. Items just looks at your endgame items on your units vs the most popular endgame items on the units in the comp,etc."

      "comment_body": "I see, okay. So that data is nowhere near as useful as most people give it credit for. That's good to know. Sounds like it's just results-oriented data. Most people have such a small sample of games in a given set that the data is meaningless. People always say to post it as if the data is somehow meaningful so I always assumed it was.\n\nI can see how if you can manage hundreds of games in a set then yeah you can *start* to make relevant extrapolation from just endgame boards but since 90% of the playerbase doesn't even play 200 games a season then they're kind of out of luck there.\n\nEdit: that's like saying just because someone lost 50 poker tournaments in a row or just because they're down 20 buyins in cash games that they're not good at poker, it's just results-oriented meaningless extrapolation unless you can see *why* they're down buyins which you could only do by talking to or watching them play."

      "comment_body": "I think comp data is still useful data as it informs players on what endgame comps they should strive to get to although it doesnt inform at all how you do it or in what contexts its more achievable (ie fast 9 comps being more achievable in scuttle puddle or econ encounters/augments)\n\nI would however argue that augment data is absolutely very useful and maybe the most useful data out there because it is some of the only data that comes with context. It always comes on the same stages (unless an encounter messes it up), meaning you know its performance when its taken early vs midgame. This is some of the only data that paints what the game may have looked like beyond just the end game state. For instance looking at augment data youd see that inspiring epitaph, martyr, and gifts from the fallen tend to do poorer when picked as a first augment but do well as later augments; this intuitively makes sense as you have less units in early and therefore less units to die, so you may skip these augments early on but should absolutely pick them later. This is just one example of how augment data can inform how you play in various stages of the game. The other thing to note is that on average not too many team comps (unless its a super unbalanced patch) have crazy good placements or major discrepancies vs the rest of the comps, but this is less true of augments. There r some crazy good augments in some patches and if you see their placements being 4.0, etc you should absolutely pick them but the flip is also true: there are AWFUL augments. End game comp data and placement doesnt take into account how hard some of these comps are to pilot and so there is some voluntary bias in the sense that very difficult comps on average will have more good players attempt it than bad players, and so results may be skewed. It doesnt take any skill to click an augment and few augments really require that many gameplay changes or skill expression to min-max so augment data is more useful since a high placing augment may just be a plain good augment. You can also see sample size of how often an augments picked in each stage so if you see good placement high sample size you know its a good general augment but good placement with small sample size means u probably only want to pick it in very specific situations. This is a lot more context than just end game comps"
