There were a few maps but they were all on a small baseplate and there was no lobby.\n\nI also remember there was a points/coins system that allowed players to buy items. There were always very full servers so it wasn't exactly an unpopular game. I just want to find it again because i spent hours of my childhood on it and want to play it again.\n\nThank you in advance for any help finding it :)"

I really hate that the full-sized menu doesn't show the experience name anywhere in it, like if I'm playing a new experience and someone asks me what it is, I can rarely remember the exact name.\n\nIs there a hotkey or setting you can change to get to that smaller menu without a controller? Or am I dumb and there is a way to see the experience name in that full-size menu?"

I can't really think of how it was specifically, but I remember Cubes being a bit part of it for leveling or unlocking new abilities/elements? It wasn't like other elemental games where you role for rare powers and reset your level and all, it was more of a traditional MMO RPG but with very fast paced PVP/PVE content. I remember the theme of creatures was they were shadows I think? It had a gigantic map also and I believe fast travel... I was popular, or mildly popular back then, but I can't find anything about it on google or youtube. Does anyone have a clue what game I'm talking about?"

I understand they need to be approved by moderators, but is there a place I can check the status of them? Will I be emailed when they are approved? I cannot find any confirmation that I uploaded something in the first place, which is odd to me.\n2. How does pricing work? Does the creator (me) set the price on items after they are approved?\n3.

And for the past few years, I just CAN'T remember the name! Here is what I remember about it:\n\n • it was some sort of wildlife donation program • you could play as many different animal species like eagles, wolves, ostrichs, many monkey species, and basically a lot of different species \n\n• you could place a tent as a human, nest as a bird, and a den(?) as a ground animal, and you could enter it and decorate it \n\n• you could recycle trash you found around the map for the in-game currency, which could be used to buy more species (maybe skins but I don't know) \n\n• any money they got from robux was given to the wildlife program \n\n• there was a crystal cave next to the spawn area, which was up on a hill with maybe 2--3 house on it \n\n• There were different objects like sticks, rocks, and leaves around the map that you could pick up\n\n• as certain species you could climb the vines in the jungle area\n\n• it had a savannah, jungle, planes, crystal cave, tundra, forest, and a mountain biome\n\n Any help would be appreciated!

      "comment_body": "I've been playing Muffin Kombat 2 recently. It's a fan made sequel to the original by POOPENGUIN from 2015.\n\nIt's honestly fun just turning my brain off and doing some wave defense gameplay for a while. It's got a decent amount of variety from weapons and upgrades, and it's had a recent collab with The Battle Bricks, which has brought in more players. (Though I haven't played TBB)\n\nThere's just a few gripes:\n\n* it gets very hectic, very quick. New enemy variants are introduced regularly as waves progress (max 50 waves) with some just being harder versions of existing units (tank -> heavy tank -> prism tank, etc) or being two existing archetypes combined. (Exploding + giant = giant rusher) \n\n* similar to the last entry, there is an ungodly amount of stuff going on at once. Friendly NPCs constantly spawn, later rounds spawn many enemies of each class, support items are on timers that restart the moment the countdown is done, lots of enemies and players use explosives, muffins start getting dropped behind lines ODST style, etc. Gameplay beyond wave 35 more or less is just \"shoot at the UAV marker you can see through all the explosion smoke\". And that's not even getting into the chaos that is boss fights. For all that is holy, DO NOT LET THE BOSSES GET NEAR THE FLAG, LEST YOU WANT TO BE SPAWNCAMPED.\n\n* there isn't too much long term progression besides Badges. All weapons and upgrades are lost upon your session ending. And servers shut down upon completion/loss. Yes, event Badges and Mad+ completion do unlock things, namely, playable muffins as the latter and special muffin units for the former, but that's really it so far. It is getting updates, so we shall see if more comes.\n\nStill, if you enjoyed the original way back when, I'd recommend giving this one a shot.\n\nI've also been playing some Reign Fall, which is looking to be a zombie-ish shooter with skill build stuff, and even played the OG to get caught up, but that's paid early access, and judging by the \"played during paid access\" badge, has already received a noticeable popularity spike. Did get Super Supporter, tho, it's already looking good for Paid Access.\n\nI have been looking at playing a game called Sharkco, but idk. I'm not good at melee deathmatch games.\n\nEdit: one last mention, but I tried out Roblox At War a few weeks ago. Haven't played it much rn, but it's still getting updates. Fun if you're into Battlefield style gameplay. Old School, tho. Seriously. Like, hot damn, emulating the old 2013/14 style UI? And that one weapons framework which I will always associate with Zombie Tower? Mmm. Too bad the server I first played in had us getting spawncamped by APCs and a drone spammer. Was fun later on in the Vietnam map, though."

They just won’t ever see my money because it feels pointless to buy all these things for one game, then suddenly it unexpectedly dies or something, or slowly dies over time where it gets boring.

The judge would then pick his favourite answer from the list of player-written words for the prompt and then they would win. The aim is to write the most funniest/likeable comment in the gap and you win. This game was fairly popular, not as popular as main page but lots of people still played it. It's also different to the other word games and is probably of its own kind because you can actually type what you want onto the card. \n\nHelp pls."

Referring to my previous argument, a few almost insignificant things would already cost you a lot, therefore making the \"cheapest\" outfits still very much costly. Before this shtty update, we were able to avoid wasting so much robux by seeking cheaper versions of things, making it possible to get even up to 10 outfits with 1700 robux.

Not really talking about children under the age of 14, since they cant have a job and probably get gifted robux from time to time. When it comes to adults, I like to take into consideration where they work, how much their rent is, how much bills cost, where they live, etc. They should set aside money for groceries and repairs and then leave themselves with a budget. Going based off of the common statistics where i live (1,150 rent (if you have rent), 900 groceries, 213 in bills, all monthly, and a minimum wage of 12 per hour. with a federal tax of 10%.) With those statistics in mind and saying you take one vacation day, (other days off are paid,) you make 86.4 daily. Multiply that by 30, you get around 2,600 dollars. All of the bills add up to 2,263, leaving 337 free dollars. Setting aside 50% for saving, you get 168.5 dollars to spend. That's 16,850 robux right there. Also, that is with a 1,150 dollar rent, taking away that rent if you own a place, thats a lot more robux. (could be an error with my math, lmk if i did anything wrong)"

But again, i am not talking about a person whos doing okay or very well financially.\n\nThe situation is completely different in other countries. Speaking from experience, since im not well off, i have to be very careful while buying stuff in games. This used to be completely fine with me before this new 65 robux cap, since, again, i could get 10 outfits with a decent amount of rbx like once a year, but considering that i can barely get 4 avatars with 1700 goddamn robux now, it is absurd.\n\nMy point basically is that i just find it very stupid that only people who are doing mildly good or good can get the full experience of roblox.\n\nIt is a very known game, and it can be accessed by all types of people for free. So, I simply believe people who live paycheck by paycheck should be able to get their silly little accessories whenever they want to, as well."

  "self_text": "Any Roblox player with enough time on the site knows that p2w means pay to win, which refers to players who spend robux on things or games with many products. This little guide explains my opinion on what makes a game p2w.\n1. Gameplay\nThe gameplay of a game can determine if it can be considered p2w. If the game is simple, and easily accomplished without spending, then it can be considered not p2w. Even if it has game passes, it doesn’t mean it’s p2w if said passes aren’t needed to do good or if the passes don’t give significant advantages\n2. The products\nThe things that a game sells can give a good idea if it is p2w. For starters, if a game has a pass that gives you a skin with little advantage, then it clearly isn’t p2w. But if a game were to sell something that allows a player to easily beat other players with minimal skill, then it could be considered p2w. If something like that exists but other free things in the game can easily counter it, then it wouldn’t need to be considered p2w.\n3. Genre \nThe type of game you play with game passes can mean if it is p2w. If it is a pvp game that sells passes that give unfair advantages, then it’s probably p2w. But if it’s a teamwork game base around pve (randomly generated droids for example), it could stop be p2w, but it wouldn’t be a bad thing since it supports others.\nThat’s the main basis of what I believe to determine if a game is p2w.\n(If it locks features that should be Fre behind a paywall, then it’s absolutely p2w)",

This is why I've decided to use two avatars on Roblox nowadays lol, a more gender-ambiguous one (always interpreted as male by players without me telling) for everything else, and a more traditionally-feminine one for chill games that don't have teaming or have an already predominantly-female fan and player base lol."

You should really just be you… but the avatar option is probably ideal. I’m very sorry you have to deal with this… everyone should have rights and power… including women. However it’s not just women being impacted, it’s also just the cesspool community that is of fighting/brawler games. It’s a very sad truth… but it’s proven correct many times before.\n\nFrom my experience, when I first joined The Strongest Battlegrounds: I got constantly targeted and tagged teamed by 5 different players because I had a “skill issue” and because I’m “weak”. This admittedly made me so frustrated and hurt because I literally just got in. After that incident, I never touched battlegrounds again. Similar thing happened in Among Us because I was the color blue with a happy face. It’s SO stupid and there’s barely any reasoning except... I guess jealousy or envy.\n\nI never knew why this shit happens on the platform constantly but it always aggravates me so much. I’m a teenager right now but this is just unacceptable, and I’d love to team up with you if I could. But yeah… it’s honestly sad that the Roblox Moderation team has been neglecting their community and actively going against people who are the most entrusted. And this is just one example… I absolutely love how the report doesn’t do anything useful because the team is so money-hungry and careless. It sucks… and the fact they’re are guys like this belittling you is unacceptable. Men. Women. Everyone. Should be treated equally.\n\nI wish I could help you more… because if I was on the moderation team… I would fire the people currently and hire actual genuine people. And I would give a damn. Anyway… guess you gotta make another avatar until this actually addressed. For now, I’d suggest just sticking to your type of games you have refined skill in, alright. Hopefully this BS doesn’t happen again!"

You give yourself an unnecessary amount of stress by hiding who you are rather than just being yourself and not caring about other peoples' opinions, altogether.\n\nBelieve me. The problem has absolutely nothing to do with your gender. Depending on the genre of game it is, boys will either be sexist bullies on the basis of masculine pride upfront or sore losers that cry when a girl outsmarts them by accomplishing a certain skill or task that they lack the proper mindset and/or determination to master themselves. \n\nRather than taking the time to assess what steps the girl followed to gain an advantage in the first place, they simply attack her success by making absurd accusations or creating excuses for themselves as to hide their embarrassment from being too lazy to put forth enough effort to achieve the same goal.\n\nSuch a case is especially prominent in the world of competitive online gaming, where a majority of boys will do this often to girls who aren't afraid to go against them if they have to. It's sick, but also an unfortunate parallel of what happens in the adult atmosphere of the gaming industry."

Tons of people in fighting games are just toxic assholes that beat you up and say toxic shit for no reason, no matter the gender. Being female probably just adds to the variety of insults they throw at you, which defiantly sucks but it’s something both genders experience, presumably just to a lesser degree if your a male. Being male doesn’t just automatically exclude you from gender based insults, as they still get thrown out from time to time.\n\nTLDR: Roblox fighting games are a shitshow and fighting games are usually much more toxic then other genres of games on Roblox."

That's pretty much what it is, at least what I believe it is, there are a couple more reasons actually, some male players just like to play with other males, as I've stated before, I never really did this, actually, most of the online friendships with genuine longevity were from female players. Anyways males play with males, those who prefer this might not actually hate female players, even if it may seem like it. I don't know how to give you tips at acting like a male, and I don't even know if you still want some, but it's pretty easy, you just gotta find the right people, people you relate to, my little sister frequently hangs out with males and uses a male avatar(I don't like knowing that though, she's only 12.) Some advice, try to see if your male avatar matches your personality, like see if other users have a certain style, that matches your personality, use that style, and I'm pretty sure you'll fit in, there are a lot of females that I talked to that had a male avatar that fit a personality, I had no idea."

Their army primarily uses swords and longswords, as well as great swords and axes. Their navy is not as powerful, as it mainly consists of Ketches and Brigantines. As the kingdom is ruled with an iron fist by King John Smolder, the people are typically very oppressed without as many freedoms as there used to be under previous Smolders.

But for many months of playing Bloxburg, there's a lot of players have complaints and they rant it on tiktok and the reason is they believe that Bloxburg will be free, which players who pay 25 robux got furious because they think Bloxburg will be like Brookhaven. Not gonna lie it's ok since people couldn't afford it, can now play the game but those who pay for it will never let it slide, I see some players building wall in their home in Tiktok, some of them even have some armed guards which make me think that how they can do that?, someone is also building a bunker like it was a Apocalypse, and the separation between who pay 25 robux and those who pay free. Also there's also another issue the update, in the update you need to pay hospital bill when you fainted, which expensive I think it cost $1,700, when your car is towed you need to pay it unlike before the update it will just respawn again to your house, and also the pay is based on your level. This led to many players to go protests. Is Bloxburg is really getting out of hand? ",

  "self_text": "Hi, first time here in this subreddit, and sorry about the long post.\n\nSo, I have a friend I usually play with, and often times he'll joke about me being older than him and stuff like that. Thing is, he invited me to play **The Nursing Home** and I accepted, knowing what he wanted to do.\n\nDo take note that during all this situation **we didn't speak English**. Of course, I know how to, but my friend struggles some with it. Which means that we simply stuck to speaking or native language, and *ONLY INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER.*\n\nFor the first few minutes we had fun kinda role-playing as a grandpa and his niece, though about 10 minutes in, we ran into a rather \"strange\" Security Guard. She was wearing a red dress and black wings on her arms. Sadly, I didn't take note of her name (you'll understand why).\n\nI was going wherever I wanted, not following the itinerary, and simply carrying my friend to random places. Attending a funeral, getting a room, joining a yoga class, and at last, going to play Bingo.\n\nWe wanted to see what happened if you won, so my friend and I sat down for a bit, trying to fill our cards. I just needed one more number, and it was sadly then that the Security Guard grabbed me out of the chair and... I couldn't continue my Bingo card.\n\nI said \"Ugh, this girl\" to my friend, and afterwards, we both teleported over to my room, annoyed over what happened. And right after, the Security guard reappeared on my back. She stayed right in front of my room's door and never moved away from there.\n\nOnce the next activity started, I brushed past her and walked over to the front door. Then, my friend pushed me to the floor, and my aged character just wouldn't stand back up. I tried to get up fast, since the Security Guard had caught up to us, but this time, whenever I was close to standing up, she was PUSHING ME back onto the ground.\n\nI got tired of her, so I called a nurse, pressing a button that said I had a broken bone, thinking they would help me get rid of her that way. To my surprise, it was then that I was starting to discover what was going on.\n\nOnce a nurse came over, she picked up someone else instead of me, visibly ignoring me, and I jokingly complained. In all caps, I said \"HEY, THAT'S THE WRONG PERSON, I'M STILL HERE\", while my friend was saying \"Come on, the security guard is bothering us\".\n\nBut we froze, as we suddenly saw a new notification on the top of the screen, reading (in English) \"Report \\[My friend\\] and \\[Me\\]\". Followed by 1 or 2 players in the chat saying stuff along the lines of \"get rid of the annoying spanish people\".\n\nThere were *200 players* in there, so we left immediately after that. Not wanting to take any chances.\n\nTo this moment, this had left a bittersweet feeling for us both. We weren't even insulting them or purposefully annoying other players. It was just us both laughing and playing around with some of the stuff, or me sometimes asking my friend how to do certain things.\n\nIf they didn't want to have people speaking in a foreign language, they could have TRIED to PM either of us about it. They could have put up a notification saying \"Only English allowed in the chat, thx\", or even told us \"Hey you guys, you're speaking a lot, please stop\".\n\nBut no. Whoever was it, choose to announce for 200 PLAYERS THAT THEY SHOULD REPORT US, WHILE WE WERE JUST MINDING OUR OWN BUSSINESS.\n\n**TL;DR:** Friend and I got ignored, somewhat harassed, and incited to be reported by other players simply for speaking a foreign language in the game \"The Nursing Home\"'s main chat.",

Roblox story games are pretty much uncharted territory in my experience so I can’t say anything towards how well they do, but you’re still free to make whatever you want. However, the cult following of Brick Bronze might offer some insight as to what would happen if you tried to replicate your own “Persona” game on Roblox.\n\nAs someone who’s spent an exorbitant amount of time wondering the same idea, I’ve come to the conclusion that since those games are so disproportionately large for one or a couple people to make, they’re best suited as nothing more than a hobby project, at which point the reception becomes an after thought as the payment to the creator comes in the form of the enjoyment found through the process of creating.\n\nIn terms of originality, I ask myself the question of “As a persona fan, if someone told you there were a knockoff game with a fully-fledged story, persona combat, and social links and characters that you could play for free, would you?” and the answer is always a resounding yes."

Normally when you play the game theres different things that happen to the environment, and one of them goes dark and you can barely see anything. When it happened we were on a car while we were driving in the dark, and my friend said the car was \"getting stuck\" and when he moved around the car randomly turned around. He described it like he was in a freaking cutscene or smth😭😭 And I told him yooo what if something happens sarcastically. Then when i turned around, half of my screen turned pink (i couldnt click on the roblox app button) then a black screen with white texts and numbers like 3a B4 or some stuff like that and my game crashed. We tried checking what it was and apparently there was a glitch in roblox that happens in apple where apple devices do that. And the guy driving my friend saw A black arm when the car was flipped. Tbh i dont believe it myself because I didn't think something would actually happen and I should have gotten it recorded because I literally did not expect that LMAO (it felt like a horror game)\n\nIdk its either overreacting and its the pink screen thing or a hacker went in our server I jus need to know if other people got this pink screen thing aswell.\n\n(i had to repost this twice because the bot wouldn't let me send a video that looked like it im sorry if i did anything wrong🥹)\n \nP.1",

I started off by changing other people's scripts and customizing them, then it got to me making my own scripts. I kept going with it and kept developing, eventually making tablet admins (tab admins as some call them.) And making money off it. I had also made a couple games in this time as well as done some contract work for games.\n\nI kept going with game development and now here I am having gone to RDC 2017-2020, and 2022.

Want to play a paintball game? Go to Roblox. There’s a game where you can drive a train off a bridge? Go to Roblox.\n\nAn older student (as in, 3rd grade) went around to all the computers in one class and downloaded Roblox, so installation wasn’t an issue. The school never did block the game, so it was a fun time waster. Eventually we got a computer at home, and it went from there"

I played on his laptop, I remember being a guest and having to use the arrow keys/touchpad. I was 5 at the time. I vividly remember freeze tag games, and minigames with a lobby with big colorful balls you could push around.\n2. When did I start playing Roblox consistently? 2014, I installed a IOS app on my iPad, called survive the disasters (it was natural disaster survival, but its own app) that’s when I really got into Roblox. I would strictly play the survive the disasters app, until it got discontinued. When it got discontinued I switched to actual Roblox and started playing things like hide and seek extreme. I was a big fan of Bereghost Games also, I bought his whole overseer outfit. He got me into 90% of the games I played, including the BEST murder game on Roblox (Twisted Murderer)"

I actually haven't thought of it much since I usually played flash games and browsed other kind of games and plenty of things so I just wasn't yet interested.\n\nBack when I joined social media I noticed some bigger YouTubers including Minecraft YouTubers that I liked watching play Roblox as of 2016 so that's when I decided to create my Roblox as of December 20, 2016 on my good old white Samsung tablet (which I still have). I also wasn't yet aware that at that year was also the great era where a lot of people including myself would make Roblox skyrocket at that year.\n\nMy experience for the past 8 years on Roblox has been awesome, I played some great games, played with some people including friends, etc. And I do sometimes regret not joining Roblox back in 2012 after seeing & playing some of the coolest classic Roblox games (Including some Roblox events) and how Roblox was like but eh at least there are some people that still make Roblox games in a classic/retro style."

Back then, I had recently upgraded from Windows 98 SE, but it was still a tube PC and the specs weren't great, so needless to say it didn't work. I only played it because my father allowed me to use his new Windows XP machine with a graphics card. However, even though the PC was great for the time, the internet connection wasn't. I could only play solo and with some luck, a few games.\n\nOnce my father bumped the internet speed, I was finally able to play it without much problem.\n\nFun fact: my innocent self didn't know about Roblox Studio initially and thought the only way to build stuff was through the \"Solo\" mode.\n\nTime flies by fast.

  "self_text": "So many of you would've probably noticed the rise of  BTG \"games.\" They're very simple in concept.  \n\nYou spawn in a map, fight people, die, repeat  \nThey're so empty and bland so I wanted to review the  ones I've played  \n\nThe Strongest Battlegrounds  \n\nit's the original one, to my knowledge. It has a nice  combat system and the controls aren't bad. The Map  is bland but you can destroy some of the objects  with abilities.  \n\n\nOverall the game is fun, for as long as you're winning  fights or fighting someone of your level.  \n\n\nNow here's the problem(this extends to all BTG  games)  \n\n\nThe Players, there is no skill-based matchmaking in  the base world. So you can start the game and lose  100 fights to some randoms who played for hours  on end looking up the best combo.  \n\nLike all games there are toxic players but that's  normal. Since this is a battlegrounds game there are  people who willjump you. People will spam \"ez\" and  people will just not leave you alone. Players will not  take a loss. They will spin back with you at low hp,  kill you, then claim that it was easy  \n\n\n\nThe Characters playerbase  \nThere are different abilities with different types of  people who play them imma just run them down.  \n\n\nSaitama-Most noobs play him so he's easy to grasp  and learn. Pros will also play him and they're usually  your average NPC they're some of the cooler people  \n\n\nGAROU - there are two types of Garou players. The  first us noobs who just started and are making  combos and getting better. There are the SWEATS  Who will place you in a combo that does 70% of your  hp. Then they'll start another combo that'll kill you.  They are the most toxic people there. (If you're lucky  they might be bystanders just watching and only  attacks when Provoked and are okay)  \n\n\nGenos - Usually long range spammers or teamers  They're not to bad and are usually mediocre. They're  wide and varying in skill and personality. Some are  toxic Some are idiots so I can't really say  \n\n\nSonic - They're two types the ones you fight in a 1v1  and the third-party. The 1v1 types are average people  just like the genos players. But they're more likely to  un away when low hp. The third-party types usually  suck at the game so they're easy to beat if you catch  them of guard.  \n\n\nAtomic Samurai - The players here are nice and are  surprisingly honorable. It's rare you'll find a toxic  Samurai.  \n",

  "self_text": "Back in elementary school, I was bullied a lot. For being one of few gingers in the class, for being a little pudgy, and for being socially inept. It troubled me every day I showed up and I'd shift in my seat, urging to get home and lose myself in the computer again. Typically I'd play Minecraft or Roblox with my older brother, and even at school we'd rush to finish as fast as possible and attempt to install Roblox on the laptop I had picked out, every single time, without fail. \n\nEventually my brother's fifth grade teacher, Mr. Fernandez, picked up on this and created a club for the fourth and fifth graders called \"MineBLOX Club.\" At first it started with us watching mod showcases on the projector, but eventually it turned into us rushing to the computer lab, or rushing the laptop tray to the classroom so that we could play ROBLOX during recess. \n\nOver the next two years of elementary school \"MineBLOX Club\" helped me connect to others and find common ground with kids I never thought would be interested in Minecraft or ROBLOX, to the point where four others had admired me for the time I spent over the past three years playing ROBLOX, and decided to follow the name that I had made to copy ChadTheCreator's (DanielTheHater.) This led to four random people named \"keeganthehater, MoisesTheHater, connorthehater, and jordanthehater\" when I decided to change my username.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oiblbzflxwxc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccefd09019ec0bafb463b91db8d24449d619025f\n\nThe best part is that, in retrospect based off of my time in the club, I could tell there were others like me who were hard to open up but were easily socializing with others. It was a club made up of all different people. Weirdos would play Warriorcats RP, fairly normal people who would just play Basketball games, and others who would stick to the classics like Deathrun or Flood Escape. ",

I almost think of it as a pet sim esque game but better (you kill things to level up to go to new areas, in pet sim you break things to level up to go to new areas) it's not a bad game. It has a bad community that gives it a poor reputation."

The fighting system is okay, but half of the time, you're not even a high enough level to fight. And even when you are, you get targeted for your bounty. The grinding system is worse since you just fight NPCs, then fight stronger ones once you level up. The game has a pay-to-win system where you can just buy any fruit you want, while the free-to-play players have to stick to one unless they have a backup. Grinding without a private server is terrible since half the time you get jumped by randoms, and even if you wanted a private server, you'd have to pay 200 Robux. I have no idea why it took me so long to drop the game, but I hate it with every fiber of my being now."

I grinded to max level constantly because I had nothing else to do, just came home from school and grinded the rest of the day. It gets fun once you're max level, and you can actually fight people, but then there are difficult quests and tasks to get other good upgrades and weapons. It's fun once you get there. Is it worth spending 200 hours grinding just to get to the fun part? That's up to you."

Apart from that the community sucks, hell half of them don't even know it's based of One Piece, some of them don't even know what One Piece is, and they go around telling people that Blox Fruits created this and that and that games are \"copying\" Blox Fruits.

There's so many noobs and shit that flood games where it gets to the point where they see easy and click immediately. I'm not saying it's wrong for new players (probably 5-8 year olds) to join but they're the only thing really helping games get players because not even a single game can be relevant for a year. I still play evade because i think it's fun but the amount of noobs flooding in is horrible. It's hard to find actual players because a majority of the game is flooded with noobs who don't give a hard map a chance and see easy and click on it immediately. Like there was an option for 2 normal maps, a hard map, and an easy map and they clicked easy immediately. I was playing blade ball the other day and istg 5/10 ppl were bacon hairs. Speaking of blade ball a lot of games are falling off so they resort to giving you 80 pop ups to the point you got no space on your screen"

But like all good things, it gets absolutely ruined and now it's absolutely stale. \n\nThe base game is still very well enjoyable, and it's great that the devs always put cool and funny updates (This year's April Fools being my favourite). \n\nI do agree though that it feels like Justin's the only one who really cares about the game. Bijuu Mike too, sometimes, but Think is just on another level - that's not even a good thing. I grew up watching Justin, and it's kinda sad how he fell off, (and circling back to Doors), and that it feels like he's absolutely milking the already dead cow. Some of his challenges are interesting and fun to watch, but most of the time, it's just really *eh.*\n\nStill looking forward to the game's Chapter 2 though lol."

What they could do is develop a gamemode or floor 2 so you can have a similar but different experience"

    },
    {
      "comment_body": "OP I know you're not saying the game is \"bad\", and I can definitely see where you're coming from, but here's my opinion.\n\nQuality: It's real clear that a lot of love is put into it. The models are sleek, the animations are smooth, there's little bugs and for me; the game-play is fun. Quality-wise there's not much to complain about.\n\nHorror Aspect: Doors can be really frightening... only for about the first 5-6 times you play it. I got used to the jump-scares extremely fast and most of them aren't scary as you see them coming. It does an exceptional job of putting tension on new players, but the game isn't ambient, dark, or realistic enough for that tension to stick beyond your first 10 games.\n\nBut that's not say it's a bad thing, I can't really say that I handle horror games well and I'm sure a lot of others feel the same, this just feels easier on the nerves.\n\nGame Design: In terms of difficulty, doors isn't anything excruciating; but in some cases it's especially unforgiving. However once you conquer the game mechanics, it's only a matter of your own awareness. When I'm playing Solo, 7/10 times I'm at fault for dying and I know it. On top of that, mobile players aren't directly handicapped which I'm sure the community appreciates. And it's RNG and high-score / arcade game feel provides nearly infinite replayability.\n\nIn the end, I'd say it's a good 8/10 or higher game, I do wish I got into it sooner but over-saturation by media drove me away, so I can relate to your opinion.\n\nCrown if you read all that 👑"

However, due to it not being an Roblox game in itself, it is really only visible to a very limited audience. The world is set to release around this weekend, and I hope some people here would be able to spread some word around. Thanks for reading.",

That seems to be a thing with SM64-inspired Roblox platformers)\n\nItem Asylum\n\nAverage Plate Gaem\n\nThe Rake Remastered (only has 2 songs but it’s Wind of Fjords arrangement is awesome)\n\nFlood Escape 2 (I have only played the first Flood Escape but I heard that FE2 has a good OST)\n\nAnd of course… Super Bomb Survival. (I’m gonna glaze over this so hard) It’s my 3rd favorite soundtrack of all time. You got some calmer tracks like Stargazing or Watching The Bombs for the Spectators, some real funky ones like Stinger 20 and Intense 7, and the good old Lobby. But most of the soundtrack is very action-packed. Specifically the entries added in 2022+ have all been absolutely KILLER. SkyTheFloof finds a way to perfectly capture both Intensity and Playfulness into their songs, making for some BANGERS like Lunacy 2, GIGALOMANIA, and Encounter 3. Now Sky is a GameDev themself, and incorporates their musical style very well into their own games, (most notably Chaotic Bean Simulator) but I think they shine most in Super Bomb Survival. Oh and i’ve been playing for a bit so the first 5 stingers are also kinda nostalgic to me :D (Oh and as a bonus, Sky has made a fangame to Super Bomb Survival called Sky’s Bomb Survival and both the game and the ost definitely recapture that same magic as the OG)\n\nAnyways. Please check out a lot of these. I would be here forever if I wrote about the same length as SBS for every game."

The issue is that Roblox aren’t doing nearly enough to fight back against the predators, but you can’t really expect them to when their moderation is in the dump.\n\nAt best, if you happen to be from the EU, I can suggest [submitting an EU report](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/23607654421524-Reporting-Illegal-Content-in-the-European-Union), as those tend to be more effective."

Found out my alt had joined the same server, completely disconnected from my main in all ways, and to test this wasn’t just coincidence, I left on the alt, joined back and got the same server, left both accounts, made my alt join a completely random server, and same with my main, and as I suspected it joined the same one.\n\nSo long story short these aren’t just coincidences, they made it possible that anyone within a certain distance from you can join in, potentially as a way to “make nearby friends” I’m guessing was their plan, but as the original post states, this is a real big security risk… I’m just as worried about this as them."

I.E ripoffs of Roblox limiteds, toy code items, etc. Roblox had it in their rules for the original ugc program to not copy already existing Roblox items.

Meaning they don't want copies of any item's that are officially made by Roblox."

It’s very good that your taking in criticism and suggestions.\n\nContinue creating animations, watch tutorials, and keep asking for criticism. Soon enough you’ll see crazy improvements in animating and I suggest that you eventually expand out of Roblox and into blender.\n\nKeep it up G"

I think Roblox is trying to push people that didn't purchase Robux or purchase at a low amount out from the main picture.\n\nSee, without Robux, we might not be able to get the full experience, etc. I think they trying to make this into a high end game, where the primary focus is on paying players. Non paying players can still continue, though the cosmetics of their avatar is limited. Cause I have seen it happen multiple times now, where people will complain buts it's the lower income people whereas the richer ones will just continuously pay like zombies.\n\nThough if it done correctly, it can be successful, where a game that I once played is now doing great, as they did this and brought new content which rejuvenate the game.\n\nThis is not pay to win btw, since it's only pay to win IF THIS HAPPENS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXPERIENCE. So Roblox is in a perfectly legal place to increase or decrease the value of Robux. For Roblox, the Robux offered is only for cosmetic stuff.\n\nBut under current Roblox management?

I have always had a vast financial freedom, even though I am middle class, I have always been well received by my parents, they always gave me what I wanted, but I never demanded them of anything, I am not and I have never been spoiled, I always let things happen at the right time, without rushing or anything, besides that I am quite polite, making me to take money in a \"free\" way at the time I wanted to. I am a person who spends most of my free time at home, watching series or playing, things I love to do, but these days I was trying to find a game to play, and in a frantic search, I met again with All Stars Tower Defense. Having said all this, my type of person, my financial freedom and why I started all this, I can talk about the rest so that you understand more what I mean through this text.\n\n*Because I started with all this:*\n\nSince I was 12 years old I liked the promise of anime games, because I like several animes, and it has always been a dream of me to be able to play a game of my favorite anime, and in this we got to Roblox where there is a wide variety, such as games like Blox Fruit, All Star Tower Defense, Locked and etc., but what really caught my attention was Tower Defenses, because somehow I have a huge taste for this type of game, and I \"think\" better than other tower defense games like the great example \"Bloons TD6\". I played All Star Tower Defense when I was a child since the beginning of the game and Anime adventure last year, I will not talk much about this time because they will be strongly linked to the arguments I will present about my experience on these games.\n\n*What differentiates Tower Defense from Roblox anime to a normal Tower Defense:*\n\nI will consider that you know how a Tower Defense game works, so I will not go into details about the \"action\" of the game. Remembering that not all anime tower defenses are exactly like that, they only change little. In the game you have 3 types of currency, Gold (which serves to buy characters that serve to evolve other better characters, which can also be dead in story mode), the Gem (which can be used in two Banners) and the worst of all, Stardust (which can be used in 4 specific banners for it, which has the high-class characters), but a great summary of this shit, is clearly a Gacha game mixed with MMORPG and Tower defense, a combination that we will combine, it is already a great Red Flag. The rarities of the dolls are from 1 to 7 stars, where to evolve them you need other characters, which you can get either in the banner or in some other way. Speaking more about the banner, they all update every 1 hour of clock, where there is the pity (amount of rolls needed to win the rarest character of the banner), and a 10% discount if you gave 10 rolls at once, since the value of the banners in general were very accessible, but the real problem was the WAY to get these coins. Now talking about the types of \"minigames\" that are inside, I will delve a lot into this in another topic, but know that this is the main factor to evolve the characters, get the coins of the game, and have the materials to make the orbs. In these minigames there are two modes, the Normal that you get only ONE unit (character or material) in each match, or the Extreme mode that you get Three units, in addition to having an increase in the amount of gems and gold you earn. I won't talk much about the orbs, because they only give buff in one character only, and to get them you need materials that are obtained in one of the minigames. Explained how the game works, I will talk now about the basis of all the problems of the game:\n\n*The high influence on addiction to anime Tower Defense games on Roblox:*\n\nIt is not news that the addiction to games exists because of the origin in each situation, and it is something that happens when you least notice it, and in games they are not different. In search of satisfaction, running away from reality, being powerful in a digital game is what most people who suffer from this addiction seek most of the time. Since I am talking specifically about the anime tower defense games in Roblox, which already have elements that favor this kind of thing (as I said earlier of being Gacha and MMORPG), becoming perfect for an addiction, especially from a platform where it is focused specifically for children and pre-adolescents. In this and any game, people want to get powerful as soon as possible, a will that will accumulate over the course of the day to return to the game, to be the best, to have a goal deck of the game as quickly as possible, and it is normal to have a sense of competitiveness, but it is when the addiction comes in, when you create an obligation in your head, at one time or another you will have, an example that happened to me is when you are going to spend impulsively the money you have because the currency of the game that you got for free It was not enough to catch such a character, because this exact character does not appear all the time on the banner, he leaves and it is never known when he will return, and the feeling of losing something, that of delaying your process and evolution in the game, will leave you frustrated, and this frustration will not teach you anything but to play more and MORE the game.\n\n*How much time you need to play this type of game:*\n\nAs I said earlier, to evolve the characters you need to get resources, which are obtained in minigames, and what is the problem with this? Simple, IN EVERYTHING. These minigames are \"time-consuming\" even at 3x speed and auto-skip, especially when you are going to evolve stronger characters, which will also not help much since you have to be with a deck with at least 3 goal characters in different areas, because simply the game in NORMAL mode is difficult (in this I am considering only the evolution of the goal characters of the game), and remember that I said earlier that in each match in normal mode you receive only ONE UNIT OF THE RESOURCE NECESSARY TO EVOLVE YOUR CHARACTER, so you MUST need the help of people with decks Of minimum level (which already requires many hours of gameplay) or superiors to carry you (which is most of the time), and you say \"and why not in the extreme?\" And I answer with all sincerity, it's IMPOSSIBLE, unless the eight people (maximum capacity of players per match) have an extremely overpower deck and goal NO MINIMOOOO, and I'm not even sure. In addition, the characters need ENOUGH RESOURCES TO EVOLVE, if we count on the time and how much you earn in each match, and these factors cause you to spend HOURS AND HOURS of play for A POWERFUL DOLL.\n\n*The most Pay to Win currency, Stardust:*\n\nIt is simply the most difficult coin in the game, the most annoying to have, because there are literally 7 ways to have it:\n\n1. Getting AFK in a specific area of the game, that you get only 0.5 stardust every 500 seconds, and DETAIL, if you are premium (subscribe of Roblox itself) or VIP (gamepass obtained through robux) in the game you double this value, which makes it a \"great\" way to farm.\n\n2. Doing tasks, which are usually not so difficult, but are granted few that give you few stardust, being a means more or less.\n\n3. By paying, you can buy this currency directly through the store deployed in the game.\n\n4. Battle pass, where you can pass the level, or buy the entire battle pass, that you get even more stardust, that's the only thing, to pass the level it works almost the same way as the task, so it doesn't change much.\n\n5. Tower mode, which you gain a certain amount of Stardust by going from 4 in 4 levels and when you reach every ten you get a certain amount of more gems, but this mode requires a lot of patience and effort, because the does are too boring, and repeating and repeating becomes tiring.\n\n6. Codes, which give you a lot of stardust, but they are few and are more for beginners\n\n7. And finally through Eren, who reaching a certain level you can choose between having 500 stardust, a character and an orb, but you lose a lot of level after talking to him and the difference in the limits are significant\n\nThere are other forms, but these are the main ones. But GUESS WHICH IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF ALL!!!! THE ONE TO STAY AFK IS CLEAR, you must be like this now, \"what? But look at the minimum amount you earn every 500 SECONDS\" it may seem like a lot, but I swear it's the most effective, just look at this table and you will understand me: https://allstartd.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Chamber . It's impressive, when you're not enjoying the game is that when you make the most money? So why does this mode exist? Simple, because the creator of the game earns money to each online player in his game, and he earns more money with PEOPLE WITH PREMIUM, since those who have vip they have already won literally because you PAID TO HAVE, that is, the most effective way is literally a pay to win, because if you don't even have premium and m vip you literally earn crumbs every 500, reducing by half, and look that you still have the electricity bill to pay just in this game of leaving the pc all day on.\n\n*And finally, the outcome:*\n\nFinally, if you realized that you are suffering from an addiction not only for All Star Tower Defense but for anything, seek help, seriously. It seems that I completely hate this game but in fact it has effects and a very good promise, but nowadays I see more bad things than good things in this game, and I only touched it today, the same day I'm writing this text. I hope I have helped or entertained someone through this text, if you see any spelling error or error of any information please correct me in the comments.",

      "comment_body": "TL;DR: Too many games, zero quality control, tons of cashgrabs. A few games were alright though.\n\n  \nMy thoughts on the Hunt, as someone who has played 95 of the games:\n\n* It felt like there was no thought put into the game selection. There were THREE pull-a-sword type simulators. Like, having a so many simulators in the Hunt was one thing, but multiple with the exact same gameplay mechanics and assets is just ridiculous. There are good games out there that would do anything for a spot in an event like this and they just... put three of the same exact game in the Hunt. There were also multiple tower defense games, multiple tycoons, two very tedious football games... There's only so many types of games on Roblox, and you're bound to have repetitions when the selection of games is so large. 100 is just too much.\n* They did not care about what the devs cooked up. Many of the games made it extremely obvious that they only wanted you to stay for a long time to get that sweet, sweet Premium payout. Their objectives would boil down to, \"play this game normally until you reach a certain level that *coincidentally* takes you the amount of time I need to profit off you\". There are some games that did something cool for the event though, such as Arsenal which had a whole singleplayer mission. At least some games had a mini egg hunt on their map or themed their events after the Hunt (TDS had you play a round against the Korblox army - it was very cute). \n* Gambling. So much gambling. As someone who went inactive before monetization on Roblox became a thing and only came back for the Hunt, I was SHOCKED. I might sound like a boomer here, but I feel like we shouldn't expose kids to mechanics like this. Roblox promoting stuff like this just does not sit right with me.\n\nI suspect that many of these issues could be resolved if the devs had more time to work on the Hunt, so not everything is their fault. The fault lies mostly with the event organizers. The event was really in need of more time to let the developers make something nice, more quality control to ensure that the event experience isn't absolutely brainrotting, and a smaller selection of games with variety."

I'd like to at least have some of the fat trimmed when it comes to game selections (less games like Pet Sim or that mansion tycoon game where the objective is to just play the game and more actual good missions made for the event), or at least give us more time than 2 weeks to get 100 badges"

Roblox developers have to work directly with toy manufacturers on their own.

Iconic Roblox hats and faces also cannot be used in these toys either. That’s why they look unofficial."

These headphones also shine and hands out a better look, but it depends on the game. \n\nIt’s just odd that Roblox let these stay onsale for months."

Skills were actually interesting but due to people hating it so much they just flat out removed it without balancing it ( They've attempted too but i'm assuming they gave up on it ) then potions which is more fair due to how op they actually were but the removal of potions made it 100x more boring to fight someone.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the fighting in game is still fun to a extent. Just fighting Dragon slayer users over and over again is painful. As well as the toxicity, that is common in fighting games but it hurts in this more than any other.

They are energetic players and strategy based players, but in such academic games like \"Up For Debate\", debate a topic with them is just worse than having to complete 3 chemistry tests at the same time. Some of them keep spaming \"skibidi\" \"gyatt\" (basically Gen A language) or hulimate others regardless of their answer cohesiveness. For most of the time, the players judge the answers based on the speaker look and how modern their debate style is. Their most annoying behavior is to refer players who capable of typing long answers in a matter or seconds as ChatGPT users or AI generated speech.\n\nEverytime you hop in a server, you can see Zoomers and Millenials lost to a bacon splitting out Gen A languages or a ceramic rusty toilet with human head for most topics. Not because their answers are not academic, it just because they don't want to add sigma or chad thingy into their speech and their physical appearance is not fashionable to the new Alphas.\n\nThis whole text is just my own opinion about iPad kids and should only be read as a method of time killing.\n\n*(this whole text is generated by a human)*",

I told my dad and he said I was too young to play roblox so he gave it to my little cousin WHO WAS YOUGER THAN ME!!!! then I started playing in 2019. fun games and all. made multiple accounts because I was bored. sometimes I'd make account with the mission to get banned because I'd never gotten permanently banned on roblox before. I, 2024, still play roblox. slightly interested in JailBreak and am playing brookhaven RARELY and adopt me RARELY. I play sushi restaurant games more. pretty cool it's updated so much, option to switch accounts and we have robux now (back when I started, there was no tix, but I did hear alot of people talking about it). the price of robux is pretty cheap on mobile and IOS devices. being 1 dollar or a few cents to buy 40 or 80 robux. I don't recommend robux purchases made on websites or computer software devices as they tend to be more expensive. anyways yea that's my review of roblox.i recommend it. not bad."

I loved games like Royale High because I'm autistic and love collecting things but then when they started to hike the prices on everything (in-game currency, obvis), took away most good opportunities to make this currency, and then also made it so expensive to buy this currency with Robux, I kind of just lost interest. I understand that it's just in-game currency, but Roblox, at the time, was HEAVILY marketed to children, and it kind of pissed me off that they would so obviously turn it into a cash grab, since they essentially made it so if you wanted any of the items, it was spend Robux or grind all day every day. Hell, my sister plays constantly and even she can't afford most of the items. (I'm talking like one skirt is like 80k \"diamonds\" (in-game currency) and 20k \"diamonds\" is 2000 Robux, making this the equivalent of an 80 dollar skirt, which was RIDICULOUS in my opinion.) Then, of course, they completely shifted it to be primarily for their \"influencers\" as they called them, and I just kind of quit. And Royale High is just the example I'm using, this was every single game, after a bit. Not to mention the \"cool\" games had such an intense learning curve and I was already 16 at this point with a full time job so I could afford to like live or whatever, so I guess I sort of outgrew it in the process. I do also occasionally play, just to see what's going on, but for the most part, I've left it behind.\n\nEdit because I forgot: I'm not fully against games with microtransactions, I play a ton of COD and regularly buy skins for it, it was the sheer scale of the micro-transactions"

Sure, I remember tix, I remember the old logo and blocky games and whatnot, but in my most active years, roblox felt like it changed as much, as youtube did.\n\nOne thing that seperates me from probably everyone else, is that I actually don't mind the way roblox developed. I had my most important experience with it in 2019 and the game couldn't have existed, if roblox didn't push so much for advancing their engine. I do think a lot of charm got lost and sometimes when I check the older games, that kinda hits me a lot, but modern games are just so much more immersive. (That being the 1% of games that aren't just like sludge lol)"

      "comment_body": "2007-present\n\nive had several long gaps wherein i totally lose interest in the game or give up on it temporarily. a big challenge was when they removed the forums, since i was an active RTer.\n\nbut something keeps me coming back. ive reconnected with some old roblox buddies and my presence has spurred them on to have regular roblox nights. i also am always attracted to studio. to this day it's still one of the easiest to use \"game engines\" or IDEs for rapidly prototyping a wacky scripting concept or generally toying with ideas. its all so well-documented and kept extremely up to date, with much of the documentation even providing pertinent guidance on server-client structure issues and script architecture. roblox studio meets an extremely high bar of quality, and kinda always has for its respective times. in a way it was like Unity before Unity was even an idea\n\nit's true that the platform has its issues in the current day - lack of communication and community involvement from the staff paired with the slow removal of community hubs. a fundamental corporate inability to see and understand the charm of the platform they developed, focusing on things like the metaverse and \\*shudders\\* rthro. UGC is a mixed bag but the public UGC update and the lack of communication around it are also clear examples of the staff's out-of-touch nature and abject failure. i remember an era when they had introduced a real system for monthly site wide events and the staff team ran a regular livestream. an even earlier era where admins like Shedletsky and MrDoomBringer would respond directly to topics and suggestions in the forums. put simply they need to get back to their roots.\n\na lot of the front page is trash, though in a different way from the past. there are some very high effort games that are nonetheless stuffed with pay2win and microtransactions to the point it feels obnoxious. ive found myself having a lot of fun with Blade Ball, but am perpetually annoyed that the game's entire lobby and some of its core systems feel tailor-made to extract bobux from you rather than add to the game. not even try to do both at once. likewise with simulators, high effort games with extremely tight programming... that are also just money milkers. it's kind of sad.\n\nbut i also think people have the nostalgia goggles on a little over-tight - it's also become an increasingly powerful and easy to use gamedev tool over the years and that shows in frankly incredible games like Combat Initiation, BrickBattler, Super Cube Cavern, Find Everything, and upcoming titles like Block Tales. once you learn how to dive in beyond what the front page or discovery tabs offer and look for community driven projects, there is some serious quality here that exceeds anything possible back in the day in terms of quality, polish and generally being experiences worth your time. i almost feel like im stealing just playing some of these without handing over $20, they're that good\n\nfor reference i had a game hit the front page back in 2008. it was called Fight Inside of a Giant Noob. You were given brickbattle tools to fight each other with, but there were no unanchored parts and it all took place on the inside of a giant generic noob's head. the brain was a sphere with a scribble texture pasted on all sides. this was considered a decent quality experience in its time. it would fail to even lightly scratch the lowest tier of modern simulators in terms of asset quality, build quality, level design, scripting, or any other category. maybe creativity, but that depends on the simulator, since there are some crazy creative ones out there."

Trying to figure that shit out before YouTube guides were up was a challenge 😂 I think I was actually the first to post a video of the final world, let me see if I can find it"

A lot of people would hack accounts for items to resell which is one reason it was an enormous problem. My tactic for the largest profit was to buy high demand items for reasonable prices from the vendors, then sell on roblox for R$ and sell the robux back on the website via group payouts. The last I saw before everything was shut down, prices were absolutely ridiculous buying from these third parties. There were also many discords full of some trusted members but lots of scammers"

You could create better. \nMaybe have a deeper look into psychology of Thumbnails? \nI have no idea about that but I still would guess that there is something important about fromt items, back Items and background. \n\nIf you wanted to win me as a player, you would need a thumbnail that lets me see the enviromemt a bit. If you are an obby, show me a broad look over the obby area and I'll be interested. But the second thumbnail is the corner of an enclosed static green room.

The idea is, it’s an obby, but like the kind from 2018/2019, and as I’m not a good programmer, it wouldn’t have that much monitozation. But the gimmick is that every few obstacles there’s a little box or something with something major in Roblox history, and like through the background there’s giant iconic players like Telamon in the beginning and towards the end there would be haz3mn. Also at the end you could submit you’re own fact that I could consider adding. Would you play it?",

Roblox being more open to users what is more likely to get flagged and what not, so we can all prevent ourselves from getting incorrectly warned or even banned. Currently the rules are very vague and even with big game developers, Roblox is as transparent as a brick wall"

Pretty much any genre works tho I'd personally rather play something unique rather than some tycoon, obby or another simulator stuffed with pets and microtransactions.\n\nOn the side, while this is active. How do people actually find in-dev games? It's hard to find any in-dev or even early access projects on youtube or twitter so I'm wondering how people actually find those. Had a fair share of opportunities to play some early access games or test but it's hard to find anything new.",

They have an OST and several gameplay videos up on the dev's YouTube, it looks awesome\n\nRoBuilder is a YouTuber who normally does simulator type build work and tends to be a clickbaity dude. I'm not a fan of his usual style, but he has a passion project in the works which is some kind of motorcycle stunt racing game set in a pretty faithful Roblox recreation of Chicago. It looks like a more casual experience than the other games I mentioned but the concept has promise and the city be looking real clean.\n\nNone of these will likely show up on the front page ever but they are all beautiful treasures, the kinds of games that make Roblox worth playing.\n\nOh and if you haven't done so yet, try Phighting.

For example, three of the many classes are Patron, Joker and Wicked.\n\nPatron can create stairs (which you need to climb 20 of to reach the top), links (to other platforms on the same level) and lifts (take you up a level). The purpose of Patron is to leave a trail for others to follow.\n\nJoker can flip stairs (they get slimmer at the top to avoid warp arounds, so that’s useful), make disco stairs and create fake stairs. The purpose of Joker is to help yourself and troll others.\n\nWickeds can destroy stairs, turn stairs into obbies and create walls to stop non-wickeds from getting through. The purpose of Wicked is to forget everyone else.\n\nAll the free alignments are balanced and it’s really fun climbing as a muggle (no magic, but you get faster and jump higher every time you rank up) because it’s easier to warp around stairs. Also, VR trolling is amazing."

It consists of **different maps and gamemodes that you can vote from**. In-game there are a bunch of **mystery boxes**, that once you run into, you pick up **items which you can use against nextbots or other players, along with some occasional items that help you**, the player!   \n- ***BONUS*** : **Nico's nextbots** is a **similar** but smaller game \\[compared to evade\\] that you can try out =)  \n--> Now, if you're **a shooter-game fan and also like war-themed games**, then **rolling thunder** is the perfect match! Its VERY underrated, but extremely **realistic**, containing multiple **customization** options along with **cool stuff you can do like air strikes after accumulating a certain amount of kills!**\n\n--> If you like **zombie / apocolypse related games**, that are **round-based shooters**, in which you can **upgade your weapons and get special power up**s, all leading to the eventual **escape**, then you'll probably like **Micheal's Zombies!** \n\n--> **Sentiel // AI Uprising -** A game where you can **fight against robots**! Its **round-based, with the main objective to protect something known as the core, a lot of side-quests as well!** Its a fairly-new game, but the **graphic**s are great, and you can **upgrade your weapons!** You can also **build in-game to block bots**! **Other features include : voting for map, fighting bosses, completing tasks, stalling bosses** etc!\n\n--> Are you a superhero fan? Try War Machines! The **graphics** in the game are awesome, allowing the player to have **cool suits that have multiple different abilities, the main goal being destroying raiders from towns, cities** etc!   \n- ***BONUS*** : You should **try Marvel and DC superheroes! It has more superhero options with all of them having special powers, the goal is to get the most kills and fight against other players! You could RP in it if you wanna i guess**-\n\n--> **Flashlight Tag - Basically A Mix Of Tag and Hide And Seek! Vote for maps, and gamemodes. Seeker(s) get a torch whose battery decreases by the second, they need to try to flash their light onto hiders! Doing so, increases their battery. Hiders can be revived and have 3 lives. Hiders can complete various puzzles around the map to decrease the battery. If hiders move, then a small light appears around them making them easier to be found, if they dont move for  a certain amount of time, then the lights turn off, making it harder for seekers to find them.** \n\n# #AUTHORS NOTE\n\nSORRY IF I MISSED ANY POINTS IN THE GAME, OR MIS-GAVE INFO, I don't even know why i spent 30 mins typing all this, I have like 50 gazillion assignments to do before tomorrow- BYEBYEYEYYEYE \\[did i mention that this is my first post- oh and i just got lazy in the last para- so just read all of it L, or dont, idk >:) also idk why i named this section \"#author's note\" its goofy but yes and dont ask why this comment is so long help"

Fully modeled and highly customizable weapons and highly detailed maps makes it something you'd find on Steam rather than Roblox. It's still in predemo so it's only bringing in a few hundred actives, but it deserves a lot more people. Highly recommend if you like playing Insurgency games.\n\nThe Red Lake: TRL is based off of SCP-354 and it's a PvE game where you have to hold off waves of Red Lake entities. Has a lot of operatives with different perks and abilities and it's all around a fun game.\n\nCentaura: Centaura is a WW1 themed game that me and my friends call \"PTSD simulator\" as the details of the game makes you feel like you are back in WW1 with an active total death counter to show you the amount of deaths the match has accumulated (largest I've seen was 20K deaths in a sever of 40). Highly recommend if you like playing trench warefare games."

It's a simple game with simple looks  \n  \n[BEAR\\*](https://www.roblox.com/games/4785497374/BEAR) (pronounced BEAR STAR), Same thing with BEAR (Alpha), except way higher quality in terms of maps, skins, kill effects and even survivor skins. Has a bit more gamemodes i think, like Waves and 1 survivor vs an entire server of BEARS (aka One Bounce) and a couple more. I dont know what gamemodes BEAR (Alpha) had besides freeze tag lol\n\nBTW, BEAR\\* Was recently discontinued in favor of Skengines. BEAR (Alpha) is going to be discontinued too I think, but they're finishing up that game as they were in the middle of doing a massive makeover to the game or something.

This is getting absurd now, Roblox has basically made the 40 and 80 robux bundles worthless now, and the fact that they are continue to do this might well lead to some kind of inflation where the increase robux bundles up, so lots more people have 800 robux, so prices go up, then all of a sudden having 50,000 robux isnt a lot anymore, so then you end up with the risks of hyperinflation. At the minimum it would be nice to see Roblox keep around 150 accessories made by roblox at 5-50 robux, so that there are always options for those at lower robux, though i fear Roblox will push this price floor junk to 100 or 150 robux at this rate."

The original avatar items seem to have been taken off the catalogue as well, and I can't find any pants with the same color; I was hoping I could find an old version of my account so that I could see if there were any copies made of the shirt/pants that I was using.\n\nAccount name is \"lokisaurs\"\n\nThanks if anyone is able to help :)"

In addition to keys to open doors, you're also collecting a number of \"goal\" items (usually around 10-20), and when you collect all the goal items you can escape and win. If you get caught by the monster, you get send back to the entrance to the maze, and lose your keys, but keep your goal items.\n\nExamples include Color Or Die, Don't Get Licked, Lights Out, and I See You (although the latter is fairly different because it doesn't have the platforming sections, or the goal items).\n\nIs there a name for this \"genre\" of Roblox games? What was the first one?

It happened to me a lot and the problem is that roblox doesnt close fully sometimes, meaning your account is still on a game server while the game itself already closed. It happens due to the bad connection most of the times. The solution is to either wait a little, and if that dorsnt work - close roblox client manually trough task manager And it also might be because of the bad connection to the server (if you get kicked midgame and not on join).

It could also be possible you were playing a donation game and you donated to someone, it's pretty easy to forget about donating to people, idrk what's going on. It could also just have been a malicious 3rd party browser extension, just stick to well known and trusted extensions"

I recommend, as a beginner, selecting Isle of Vigils as your starting location since there's a training hall there. Also, try to get into smaller servers as it's incredibly common for players to RK literally everyone they see. Trust NOBODY.

Little did they know, trouble doesn't always stay in one place. Training in the strongest battlegrounds arena to get stronger, and living in the outskirts of Lacewood City, Dominic and Caulifla's peaceful lives with their friends and family would soon be interrupted by a powerful rebellious serial killer named Grim. As they realize they aren't strong enough, they must work together with their friends to come up with plans to defeat Grim and his supporters. Grim, who seeks justice upon the corrupt bacon hair leaders and fake innocent bacon hairs who ruined his experiences at the strongest battlegrounds fighting arena, has good points, but his justice is fatal. Dominic and Caulifla cannot allow this, as Grim's influence continues to spread and spread throughout the various cities across Robloxia, encouraging others to join him. Will Dom, Caulifla and friends put an end to Grim's reign?\n\n\n",

Or the game controls itself?\n\nOne of the easiest way to determine which game is hard is to look into the popularity, and the time it took to complete/master/play the game itself, both are equally important and should not be excluded. From now on, I would be mentioning the hardest by that definition\n\n1. JTOH\n2. Scarlet Skies\n3. Waste Of Space\n\n3 of these games requires years of practice and understanding.

So if you want recommendations for roblox horror games to play with your friends, here are some!\n\nstock up- 7/10 Really cool style, it's not really a story game, more of a strategy game but fun to play with friends nontheless! You rob a store and have to get the boxes without getting caught\n\nPinstripe murders- 9/10 REALLY fun to play with friends. the style is amazing and the story is really crazy? It's very interesting and I really enjoyed the horror aspects in it. I can't really explain it but trust me it's really cool.\n\nReflection- 6/10 I really liked the story, it was very interesting. this developer has a lot of cool games. The one thing that I didn't like is that the fourth part is impossible to beat. Don't let that stop you though, the rest of it is pretty fun.\n\nChronicles \\[Horror\\]- 6/10 Really nicely styled, short story but still nice. I believe they came out with a new chapter but haven't played it yet. In the first chapter you investigate an abandoned russian laboratory\n\nTerrorbyte- 7/10 I haven't beaten this one yet but its really fun, very cool style and by the same developer as Reflection.  You are a hacker trying to gain money in your apartment while monsters attack you.\n\nKagutaba- 7/10 This isn't multiplayer but i did play it along side my friends. Very cool graphics and nice story. It's about the player doing an exorcism\n\nMurder Mines- 9/10 This one was really fun! It was made from the same developer as Chronicles I believe and the graphics are just as good. You go into a mine to investigate why you haven't heard back from the works and work together to escape.  \n\n\nIf anyone has any recommendations please comment!",

But, again, their items aren't being deleted. So yes, why would they care when they're **JUST GOING OFF SALE**\n\n**Meaning if they came back, they could put on their own items. Meaning if they didn't come back, people who already bought it still can. All it means is, if they aren't a member, their items won't be on sale. Because when you sign the damn agreement to do UGC you AGREE that one of the REQUIREMENTS IS PREMIUM.**\n\nI mean seriously. You don't understand how this works when it's clearly written and can be solved with a few Google searches? For crying out loud. You need premium for a lot of facets of Roblox. You're seriously surprised that premium has... Perks?\n\nThey ain't doing the club penguin route where you lose all your items and all your little puffles go away. Unless you weren't around for club penguin and don't get that reference. Because people's items **did disappear** as opposed to this. Truly, this is just outrage over nothing because people don't understand what they literally agreed to."

At least two years, right?"

Or if you don't wanna risk getting copyright striked, you can make the edgy items. Also DON'T MAKE ANY ITEMS WITH BLOOD IN IT, NO MATTER HOW LITTLE IT IS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DSA'ED. There's a group around known as the peak ugc discord, otherwise known as the fucking losers abusing the DSA system in roblox. Be careful with that."

(better options for developers, better engine, better anticheat, etc)\n\ni'd reckon right now we're in a kind of renaissance. we have a massive amount of technical advancements, devs are getting more support with more communication with roblox, AND the games coming out are actually high-quality passion projects.   \n(tons of well made, fun horror games, party games, singleplayer games, story games, fps games, rpg games, fighting games with deep mechanics, RTS games, Deepwoken, etc)  \n(you just have to actually put in a little elbow grease to find them sometimes)\n\nignoring when i had my personal phase of roblox addiction, I'd say Roblox right now is in its all-time peak in every category."

I feel like after covid happened, everyone on the internet just changed and I remember that I took a break in 2019-2020 from roblox and once I came back, it just wasn't the same. \nI feel like back then games weren't so pay to win, for some reason, there were more game choices to play that were different. There was bloxburg and rocitizens, now there's 20 games that serve the same purpose of both of these games and I guess it just lacks creativity. Yes, more choices in games, but they all fit in the same category, now most of the games I once played are dead. \nAlso the events. I was lucky that I was able to join some events like Halloween and so on. I also loved the Xmas gifts, I think I managed to get maybe 2 and one of them gave me black commando which was limited. \nI also loved the summer sales. I remember I snatched like 2 of those noob attack/defense and I think I bought them for 80 robux each which is a huge W compared to what they go for now. \n\nRoblox is just becoming more and more greedy each year and I've actually struggled to make friends every since 2020 on the platform. I guess it may be nostalgia, but everything just seemed so much better back then. I still play because I mean I grew up with it and I kinda got attached to it and I even managed to find people my age who also play it which is fun."

(Brookhaven being similar to a dress-up game which could be fun for some kids.)\n\nThe only exception I make for my kids is that the people they talk to are people we know in real life.

It's more like avoiding unnecessary influence from strangers if she start playing alone \n\nIf you wanna be concerned, the moment they start discussing about using other social media  especially discord. It's a  internet safety risk because it will be more uncontrollable environment under discord (unless she loses interest and doesn't bother using it. BUT still not advisable to use for a 6yrs old child) \n\n It's more concerning if a random player ask her if she wanna join a Discord server.

Example: Item that costs 65 Robux, you would only receive 20 Robux.\n\nFor me it costed 2,250 total and it would mean I need to make 113 sales to get back the fee I’ve payed in a month before premium expires.\n\nI wouldn’t know how to get recognition other than advertising, and not everyone would like the UGC I’ve make.

You might've been playing a different version of Doomspire, possibly a copy with the older tools that were used throughout 2019-2022 (as the game was uncopylocked up until 2022 if I recall). The Doomspire Brickbattle game made by the Temple of Brickbattle group uses the newer tools which are easier to use, and are less broken than the old ones.

  "self_text": "Why does Roblox keep trying so hard to appeal to everyone when the answers are right in front of them, but noooo they have to do it in some other way way to appeal to some 73 year old in a retirement home who invested money into the company. One of the ways Roblox can VERY easily expand is by optimizing their game beyond the iPhone, like seriously, anything that isn't an iPhone runs like shit, for example, I have this Chromebook with 16GB ddr4 and an i5 8th Gen and I get 20 fps in lowest settings humanly possible on arsenal, my 2015 MacBook gets like double the performance at medium settings with much worse specs. Chromebooks are such an important market for Roblox to expand, because I'm pretty sure they are aware that kids love to play Roblox at school, so why don't they just make it work properly? Another example I have is with my Google Pixel 8 Pro, a flagship phone that costs about 1300, gets 10-20 fps on Roblox, no matter the graphics settings, pixels have had this issue for years now with Roblox but this is seriously unacceptable for Roblox to ignore one of the biggest phone lineups and just say \"We are working on a fix\" ( they've been saying this since the pixel 6). And the last thing I want to rant about is Linux support, they went out of their way to ban the only way you can play Roblox on Linux, because apparently they don't want to touch Linux support, but they'll ban workarounds to this? Dave the answer to getting more players is right in front of you but your blind to it. Ok rant done have a good day",

Getting a barista spot became a real challenge with so many people jumping on the bandwagon. As a result, players started drifting away to other games like Pastriez, Kecai, and Kohau Hibachi. It's kinda sad, you know? The hype that once filled the cafes with over 10,000 players has gone down to just a handful. Serving customers used to be so fun, but now it feels pretty lonely without the likes of people waiting for you to serve them.\n\nI understand why some folks aren't big fans of cafe games, thinking they're too strict or dull. But honestly, having worked in a few myself, they're not as bad as they're made out to be. It only gets a bit tedious when there's nobody around to serve. But hey, if cafe games aren't your thing, that's cool too. We all have our preferences, and it's all good if they don't align.\n",

And yeah, they were very fun. I absolutely enjoyed working at a virtual job, going to training sessions, staff meetings, etc. And I met a lot of friends there, people who I still talk to today, I met at these groups. It was a lot of fun, and genuinely some of my best memories of Roblox from 2016-2019.\n\nThat being said, there's a reason I don't work at any of these places anymore and why I don't really care about these groups anymore. The main thing that ruined these types of games, are the influx of trolls.\n\nHoly shit, the trolling issue got so bad in recent years. And its the main reason I've since quit working at these groups. It wasn't good for my mental health to basically get cyberbullied every time I log into the game for a shift. I've worked at dozens of places, and its just annoying to stand up there at the cash register and every few customers, you just have a troller walking up and screaming racial slurs and insults at you. For a while, I was able to ignore it, but eventually I just had to leave. Its like these people don't realize there's an actual human being behind the avatar. And it ruined it for me.\n\nThe other reason I don't work at these groups, is bad management and drama. Especially after a lot of groups started using Discord, the drama behind the scenes can be pretty bad sometimes. And most people don't even know it happens. I don't want to call out any group by name, but a lot groups are way more shady behind the scenes than you'd think. And there's a lot of drama, especially between high ranks."

Don't trust anyone on the Internet, you never know who you are talking to. Even your friends can get hacked and get to you throught that and with AI invading the web, the risks of ending up on a scam scheme is higher than ever.\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to be paranoid to everything, but it's a good thing to have all of this in mind to prevent you from getting yourself hurt :)"

Maybe your playing a simulator and ur constantly tapping so you’ll have a chance of turning it on.

Sometimes we never know what's the story or behind the scenes and we are quick to assume it's nothing but greed.\n\nIf we do see the devs living their life and vlogging and posting, it's not entirely greed too. Sometimes you want to profit things from the work you made that people use\n\nRoblox gave that as an option (optional, not a mandatory thing), and it's not mandatory that plugins should cost real money.

      "comment_body": "This is the beginning of the end for plugins. Paying USD instead of robux is a huge difference for the majority of small developers or average studio users, in real life sometimes money can be hard to come by, and not only that even if we have decent money we won’t be spending it on plugins. Remember this: Anything a plugin can do you can do for free and even better, may take more time but it saves a hell of a lot of money as of now. Developers of paid plugins are very likely to lose more sales and get less revenue than if they were to sell it with robux then devex the robux.\n\nSo in conclusion this is a good update in a way because most of us are gonna start learning to do stuff on our own over time for no cost at all, in return we become better developers who is self sufficient. Most Plugins will eventually be no longer needed for the most part. Real usd can be prioritized elsewhere like ads or other stuff. That being said, NO Roblox plug-in is worth $30, or in my humble opinion no plugin is worth over $5 MAX. So this is a gift and a curse for plugin developers, they will get 100% of the revenue, but they will lose more sales and revenue than they would’ve gained with Robux/devex."

  "self_text": "Hey folks, I'm the lead dev for the upcoming game Vita Nova: Cataclysm, a DarkRP style game set 300 years in the future in an autocratic police state known as the Interstellar Union of Stars.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with DarkRP, it basically runs off of a player-based economy, where the main gameplay loop is selling goods and services to other players, there are no in-game \"stores\" with the exception of occupation stores which sellers use to get the items for other players.\n\nFor instance, if you're thirst is low and you need to buy a drink, you would need to go to someone who works at a restaurant or beverage establishment and buy a drink from them. There are lots of jobs, from selling basic life needs such as food and water, to luxury goods, to weapons and soon to vehicles.\n\nLater on we plan on implementing a resource system that will allow players to own production facilities and sell those resources to retailers so that they can create their products.\n\nAdditionally, there is a group attached which affords players the opportunity to join the military, law enforcement, legislative bodies, news agencies, etc.\n\nThe group works off a living lore system, where our lore is split into two categories: The Previous Epoch, which explains all the lore leading up to the creation of the group (basically 300 years of history), and the Contemporary Epoch which is events that are written into the history books as we go along, which are influenced directly by the actions players take in game and the group.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming an alpha tester for us, please join this server: [https://discord.gg/VXu39WKGS6](https://discord.gg/VXu39WKGS6) or contact me on discord at gogoforromeo#7402.\n\nThe game can be found here if you want to check it out first: [https://www.roblox.com/games/11275306662/Vita-Nova-Cataclysm-ALPHA](https://www.roblox.com/games/11275306662/Vita-Nova-Cataclysm-ALPHA)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ca9vfskzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c7295119b6375cf07988bf13c6558d924826fa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls6ekykzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d9587c93db8f6ffe08a81c0dc9578d2de9b61dd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q4pb1vkzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=24359dd542fe5a58bc73797b12b196ce491afee5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtcd5wkzluuc1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6372cec790ad7beeb7530280f47a7a0ed2421cb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubtoiskzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f2e8bd8f4282a9cb6d4b251b550e7e97be4b6d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh7x5wkzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05e6e7f1dcfe83b58fb4edaac6595941340b156\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3kclwkzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9de522d27e2eaa2a075e7fc235bbe2e00e8aa52\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsfm3wkzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=22c5fe244cca27fa6e75a428de35a9783eafc36b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ludjkwkzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f2f95f47f75b21851c2a3b283fdcfec57c89dc7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22mqj8lzluuc1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=34eee1768b36385b634096eb55818a816857ffa6\n\n&#x200B;",

He leaves and you use the knife to open the locked door. This is a stealth game, you will hide in dark spots then strike when the enemy's unknowingly walks past you or just gives you an opportunity to kill. You have some bricks and glasses lying around that you can throw to lead enemies to positions you want for an advantage. When you get spotted, the combat is like a soul-like game but you're weak, you're better off running away unless you have a friend with you in multiplayer. The game is pretty difficult you will definitely die a bunch of times in your playthrough but it's not that long and will only take around 2 hours. The level environment in this game is pretty creepy, it looks lost and abandoned, the lighting is great, the music and sound design is great, the rain, the footsteps, the weapons, sounds great just like you expect in a horror game. If you played a certain non-Roblox game by Rockstar Games, it seems familiar and that's because it's inspired by Manhunt, a game with way more violent scenes, that this game didn't match cause obviously Roblox wouldn't like that.",

      "comment_body": "took me 4 hours to beat. This game seems to be ping dependent despite not being online so sometimes you will encounter bugs like the red mark appearing but you attack normally or the camera at the end noticing you. Great game though, but very punishing. The enemies have like a 200 degree fov too unlike in most stealth games where they only have like 160 or less. Also the combat is VERY difficult. I prefer to just use the knife in combat cause of the fast attack rate but it takes like 15 shots to kill an enemy. Enemies parry so often you will only get like 40% of your hits to land."

      "comment_body": "I think it's great that roblox is able to have people explore more unnoticed and older games through it. Although I'm not a big fan of the roblox version of the game. Since in the roblox version, they went for smooth animations and graphics, the game has a lot more bs than Manhunt. Some shadows aren't even shadows, some shadows aren't highlighted well enough because of the smooth lighting graphics, sometimes there's no shadows at all to hide in, where there's an abundance of enemies cramped in a small room. Because Manhunt had the bad graphics (compared to the roblox version) you were able to recognize a shadow much easier than in roblox, it was more krisp because of the simple animations. Which made the game feel like you had more control. I've played through all of Manhunt, and had fun. But in the roblox version, I've found myself being frustrated over the shadow placement and map design, the animations and graphics. I find myself fleeing an enemy, looking at a dark corner and telling myself \"That's probably not a shadow.\" My advice is to play the actual game, even though it has some optimization problems, it was worth the time to fix the problems, and it's fairly always on a low price. Worth the money and effort."

Some other things about it is that you could spawn in at different islands, you would beat up enemies to unlock weapons (with one of those weapons being that a \"pew pew\" gun), there was a PvP option and a boss would occasionally spawn on the island.\n\nI know that probably isn't a lot to go off, but I just wanted to see if anybody had an idea of what I'm talking about."

If any of you guys got some suggestions let me know but I’m not too sure what to do at this point since they’re most likely not gonna check my account again.

This is annoying for when I want to join a near-empty server and when I want to join a private server that I own.  \nShiftlock also does not work, along with most of the settings that you can change by pressing esc while in a game. I can't change movement mode, camera mode - only thing I can change are the things that use the (+) and (-) buttons like volume and graphics quality.\n\nHelp would be greatly appreciated!"

You can find a slightly more in-depth view at [https://github.com/ugscjgavj/deobf/tree/main/rolinker](https://github.com/ugscjgavj/deobf/tree/main/rolinker), but the short and sweet of it is that the javascript that the landing site attempts to get you to run on the roblox site will attempt to assign your account to a different email, drain the funds of groups you own, buy/delete certain items, force log you out, and stuff along those lines. Essentially attempts to claim your account and steal its value\n\nUpdate: It appears the account used to collect the funds from the scam is already terminated. They also appear to be using the account [https://www.roblox.com/users/5762605139/profile](https://www.roblox.com/users/5762605139/profile) to track scammed players by sending friend requests to it on stolen accounts. You can see its linked twitter is the same as the name of the group the scam mentions. Enjoy  \nUpdate 2: The site they were using to host the scam just got taken down (respect to the hosting site for the fast response to the abuse email)"

I don't see any other account in the javascript, so I expect that this is where any funds are\n\nCorrection: I've done some closer looking, and it looks like the already-banned account pluginBoyBack (5739852458) was actually the owner of all the products, so they aren't earning anything other than accounts from this afaik. I've adjusted my comment above to reflect this\n\nAs a bonus, if you check my plugin favourites [here](https://www.roblox.com/users/5795262058/favorites#!/plugins), you can see every model that it attempts to buy"

You use to be able to trade with one of them too! \n\n\nYou use to be able to play as a guest and use safe chat if you wasn't at age or aloud to talk, which made it safer for kids. My parents would put me on safe chat every now and than if they saw me being unsafe, but now it's you can talk but there's hash tags which is not helpful. \n\nThey removed daily tickets and were anyone could earn tickets from making a T-shirt there was a limit though I think, obviously had to be builder club to make shirt and pants  and than the tickets were removed. Builder club got more expensive and is complete something else now,  you can only earn money if you have this subscription..ROBUX cost so much and you have to pay for it. Classic shirts and classic pants can't really be free unless it's made by ROBLOX and they can't be less than 5. Use to be able to sell them for 1 ticket.\n\nNo ROBLOX egg hunts anyone. \n\nThey've changed it so much to the point where they get more profit and just got money hungry.\n\nOkay but there some cons, better graphics and better games than there was."

  "self_text": "Hey guys! Since the last update of Roblox wasn’t realistic enough, we’re making it WAY MORE!\n\nFirstly, if you die, your account will be deleted and IP-banned, since if people in real life die, they  die forever. Also, resetting doesn’t work, so you need a rescue team to get you out of softlocks. ( u/Quarstudz_-Lapiz- **)**\n\nSecondly, you can’t change the jump height of your character. However, the more you walk/run, the faster you get, like in Legends of Speed and other speed simulators.\n\nThirdly, we’re dividing all robux counts by 100. That’s because we’re introducing Rocentz, because in real life, dollars have cents. But don’t worry, we’re dividing every robux cost by 100 too. (ex. a gamepass that costs R$999 will now cost R$9.99.)\n\nFourthly, we’re adding taxes! All the robux you make from working at a pizza place will get a 20% tax for the admins.\n\nFifthly, you can’t make BillboardGuis without our new object: Hologram.\n\nSixthly, every part in a game has a certain reflectance, brick color, and transparency depending on what material it is. You also have to *paint* parts to make them *different* colors. Also, ForceField is gone, as force fields don’t exist in real life.\n\nAnd last but not least, in order to place a part, model, or mesh, a construction team will go to the site and build it, making it take minutes, hours, or even days to make builds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe’re always looking for ideas to make Roblox more realistic!

Provided all the information about the transaction and the response from them is all nonsense!!\n\nSo I’ve been charged around 10$ for nothing, for me that’s enough to consider Roblox.com a scam. Please be aware of that and if you want to buy robux for your kids- if you still allowing them to play this game- I suggest buying it through the PlayStation account, when I did that before for my other kid it worked fine!\n\nall the best.

Unlike other in-game Egg Hunts I've seen, this one didn't seem like it was for premium payouts. There weren't any Eggs that would deliberately take you a lot of time, most of the harder ones were just skill based (especially the Cart Egg). My only \"complaint\" is about the egg that was probably meant to be like the eggs Admins could launch during real egg hunts. The one in talking about is the Featured Fabergé, which, in order to get it, you had to have a top Obby Creator launch it for you. I'm still not 100% sure what a top Obby Creator is, but im pretty sure it's someone who has 250+ likes. All and all, a pretty good in game event\n\n(None of these badges every gave you a hat)\n\n(Badges that aren't shown due to image limit: Scrambled Egg, Skateboard Egg, Toxic Egg, Pristine Egg, Wizard Egg, Cart Egg, and Featured Fabergé.)",

It becomes increasingly more difficult to find new games from small creators, let alone make a career the platform. UGC’s fueled this copy and paste form of greed.

Older Roblox is nice and nostalgic and all, but the updated items out right now are better and there’s proximity chat, and an assistant to help with coding for your game which learns from other games made and posts made on how to do it all, which is cool, even if it’s new.. but if I’m being honest, I’ll go back to old Roblox if it means there’s a mega cut-down on all the clicker sims and pet sims and afk sims and the fake title games and clickbait games. I want creative games to be popular again, not a bunch of “kill npc’s, get coins, get pets, move on, restart the cycle for better pets, oh and there’s a lot of people that play with 50+ alts so good luck getting any low ID rare pet.” Type games. The maps are nice but it’s all the same. It’s also practically impossible to get someone to help you make a game (finding a scripter) unless you’re offering a lot of money, more depending on how hard it is for someone of that experience level, and how much scripting it is.

I also miss the friend playing thing where I get to see if my friends play anything fun.

There's also the crowd that hates modern mobile predatory marketting and microtransactions, and the Linux users who can't play anymore. There's also the crowd that says these things but probably don't play Roblox anymore. Something I find about old Roblox is that the most popular games were not being as much of a cash grab as they were today, and there was a time where a lot of highly popular games were pushed way too hard in the home dashboard (maybe that still happens today). I remember there used to be more variety. Also, naturally, old Roblox was less saturated because there was less content.\n\nThere's a lot of factors that would lead someone to prefer old Roblox."

That’s fair enough. But every time I try to join games nowadays they’re all covered in microtransactions and it just isn’t fun.\n\nAlso…. 2019 was in no way “old Roblox”. IMO the cutoff for that is 2016 but in my heart Roblox was best from 2011-2014.

Provided all the information about the transaction and the response from them is all nonsense!!\n\nSo I’ve been charged around 10$ for nothing, for me that’s enough to consider Roblox.com a scam. Please be aware of that and if you want to buy robux for your kids- if you still allowing them to play this game- I suggest buying it through the PlayStation account, when I did that before for my other kid it worked fine!\n\nall the best.

Here's mine: I'm more of a slow paced tactical FPS kind of guy (i enjoy games like Ready or Not and Ground Branch) and I think people are very capable of making a  good tactical FPS on Roblox. Not only that, but so many more genre's of games could be made into an extremely well built game.

It takes skill and strategy to play it successfully.\n2. It's a team game that is awesome when people actually play together.\n3. There are a lot of variations in setting, weapons, characters that make each round fun.\n4. There are extras you can earn by searching the lobby (port) area (Starfish weapon).

He leaves and you use the knife to open the locked door. This is a stealth game, you will hide in dark spots then strike when the enemy's unknowingly walks past you or just gives you an opportunity to kill. You have some bricks and glasses lying around that you can throw to lead enemies to positions you want for an  advantage. When you get spotted, the combat is like a soul-like game but you're weak, you're better off running away unless you have a friend with you in multiplayer. The game is pretty difficult you will definitely die a bunch of times in your playthrough but it's not that long and will only take around 2 hours. The level environment in this game is pretty creepy, it looks lost and abandoned, the lighting is great, the music and sound design is great, the rain, the footsteps, the weapons, sounds great just like you expect in a horror game. If you played a certain non-Roblox game by Rockstar Games, it seems familiar and that's because it's inspired by Manhunt, a game with way more violent scenes, that this game didn't match cause obviously Roblox wouldn't like that."

If it wasn't for this game, I wouldn't be playing Roblox anymore. It's similar to Eve Online, but the biggest difference besides graphics is that you actually control your own ship manually. (and the graphics are still amazing, it's probably the most beautiful game on Roblox.) It may take some time to get to know the game, but it's so worth it if you like the same kind of games I do. \n\n\n\nIf you like space games, PvP, PvE, neither PvP or PvE, exploration, or grindy games, this game is for you. Honestly the game can get really grindy, but you don't have to grind to enjoy it. Honestly I feel like the grind makes the game feel more like an obligation and a second life than a fun way to spend a few hours whenever you feel like, but again, the grind isn't needed to have fun. There are many different play styles, like I mentioned earlier; PvP, PvE, exploration, mining, getting rich, politics, or just doing whatever the heck you want. (just be careful in PvP enabled systems. Especially systems like Gatinsir and Cid Tapa) \n\n  \nHere's a recommended fan made trailer for Starscape: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7qpaT\\_6Hb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7qpaT_6Hb8)"

Also there were no \"classes\" feature in the game, The game wasnt talked about that much back then only a couple videos being posted talking about the game and it's updates. \n\nThe game was really fun actually with simple mechanics, I hope anyone who could see this might remember the game im talking about!\n\nThanks!\n\n\\-midranker",

  "self_text": "This new World War II FPS called Scorched Earth recently blown up in playerbase reaching 1.5K players. This game is pretty much a Battlefield game but with a bit more realism.\n\n The movement speed in this game is perfect, it’s never too slow that you will run for minutes to the action only to be sniped by some bush guy nor it’s too fast that you will see bunny hoppers everywhere pretty much dominating the leaderboard. The gunplay is on the realistic side with leaning, holding breath to steady your shots, gun losing stable accuracy when you get shot by nearby bullets or explosions and yes you can roll while in prone. \nJust like battlefield players can choose various classes such as sniper, medic, assault, support, and demolition\n\nThe graphics on this game is on the low poly side, the character mostly resembles the models from Battlebit if you know that game but the maps still look great even if it mostly uses Roblox style structures.\n\nIt also has great building and destruction mechanics, you can build various structures that can help defend your objectives. Sandbags for LMG guys, small shacks for snipers, barbed wires to keep enemies  from entering your location and etc. The destruction in this game is very open ended, calling an artillery on an enemy’s structure will definitely blow it up to pieces. The demolition class can blow up walls to open paths for allies to an objective. And you can even dig your way underground to the enemies base!\n\nGame doesn’t have vehicles yet but they will add tanks in the future \n\nThe game sounds like it will put your pc on fire but surprisingly it won’t. its actually very optimized, i can run it on my ok laptop with no graphic card with not much issues. The game is polished there is not much bugs even in its demo state.\n",

In this game, you are placed inside the fictional planet \"GB-39A\" and you have to survive by either building a base, roaming the planet or raiding other bases. You can also make a team with either friends or by finding friendly people to build a base with. \n\nBuilding a base is relatively easy, but defending it can be a thrill, as it still takes about upwards of 10 minutes to fully complete a base. The game is very hard and takes actual skill to learn. ESPECIALLY the gun system! Since the developers wanted to build a Roblox game that had no customizable attachments, so that you'd need skill to operate the iron sights. So yeah, you will need to take some time to get this gun system under control. The entirety of the game is also hard to learn if you're new, because they don't work with material gathering systems, instead they work with \"Plots\" and time is basically your most valuable resource.\n\nThey have an entire lore about everything that appears in-game, but extending it is still being thought about.\n\nThe game is NOT grindy and has ZERO p2w. The only ingame-transaction you can make is 49 Robux to get a golden skin for your guns, which gives no boost in gun stats whatsoever. There is also no long-term progression in the game. You can progress on a server, but progressing for multiple servers is not possible. So when you leave, you lose everything. (Rejoining the same server is still okay)\n\nThey have a Discord server where you can suggest additions to add into the game, talk about things with the community, etc etc. Since the game has a decently sized community, you will see lots of faces in their server. I will admit that there's a slight sprinkle of toxicity in it, but nothing to be sad about. Most of the people in the server are pretty decent.\n\nThe developers have everything planned out in a roadmap (Not available to the public) and they have lots of updates planned that I am very much looking forward to.\n\nIf you're interested, I coincidentally happened to have a monument in-game on my Reddit banner, so you can just check that out if you want.\n\n[The W wiki(Fandom)](https://roblox-the-w.fandom.com/wiki/The_W_Wiki)"

You had guests which couldn’t talk and the community wasnt near as big as it is now.\n\nRoblox doesnt need any more effort into making items or kissing the community. They have UGC now. They already made it on the NYSE, grown into what it needed to be, and now its just new tests for investors. They are no longer a small indie company in an Intel building trying to make it- Oh nonono. \n\nThey still somewhat care for us, they have an idea on what we want, but just like almost any company, money is essential in some way. \n\nDevelopers vary, but before 2012, devex didnt exist. You can make real life money now off of roblox, and its alot harder to get items you may want.\n\nTo sum it up, the community is alot bigger, but the soul still remains just like it did. All it did was advance."

All you really need to know is that, if things are very far away from the middle of the 3D space (in Roblox that would be 0,0,0), it is going to start causing imperfections like that like jittering. And it doesn't stop there, the further you go, the worse it gets. This is something that affects all computer software and isn't something caused by \"Roblox bad wah wah 😭😭\".\n\nSo, my assumption is that the developer of that game just made the Droid dungeon-thing be VERY far away from center of the 3D world, which could cause very slight minimal jittering.\n\nDon't take my word for it, though.

Since Roblox uses single-point floating numbers, around 500,000 studs away from the origin is where issues start becoming noticeable.\n\nThere is nothing you can do on your end and, no, this is nothing to do with your GPU, monitor or FPS.

SomebodyStoleMyToast and IStoleYourToast Took out their energy swords ready for the final battle of the toast. Both of them battled hard and IStoleYourToast blocked most of SomebodyStoleMyToast. SomebodyStoleMyToast was about to take back his toast when IWantToast Stole the stolen toast Resulting in SomebodyStoleMyToast and IStoleYourToast making peace to take back the toast\n\n**Part 3 The search:** although both of them hated each other they had to work together to regain the toast from IWantToast. They travelled many jungles and arctics catching glimpses of IWantToast escaping. Then when they least expected it IWantToast ambushed them and damaged SomebodyStoleMyToast Leaving him severely damaged.\n\n**Part 4 The (actual) final battle:** IStoleYourToast prepared an attack on IWantToast but was quickly countered by IWantToast's sword. IWantToast ate a corner of the toast making him far more powerful that SomebodyStoleMyToast and IStoleYourToast. SomebodyStoleMyToast and IStoleYourToast performed a flurry of attacks on IWantToast leaving him with low HP but to counter the attack IWantToast stabbed SomebodyStoleMyToast and killed him making IStoleYourToast enraged. IStoleYourToast (Brutally) stabbed IWantToast repeatedly.\n\n**Part 5 The epilogue:** Now with both SomebodyStoleMyToast and IWantToast dead  IStoleYourToast had a decision to revive SomebodyStoleMyToast by using the toast or keep the toast and leave them there. Due to IStoleYourToast not a true enemy to SomebodyStoleMyToast anymore he threw the toast at SomebodyStoleMyToast and revived him ending in the toast being destroyed to revive him",

Also the kriss and ump and mp5k (and I think some others) can be 2hk now with the right setups/conversions the kriss with .357 sig is just stupidly op now as well. \n\nThey also buffed the m60 to do like 42 max damage (not including multipliers) and they buffed the g3a3 so it’s pretty meta as well right now (more so then the m60 afaik).

You have to survive in an abandoned wasteland. The lore is too long for me to weite it here. 😅\n\nAnd yes, the game is about crafting, shooting guns, killing people, making enemies and friends, etc.\n\nIt's a bit like an MMORPG that mixes Tarkov and Rust a tad bit with alot of tweaks. Expect alot of death.\n\nThey have a Discord server, which is even more toxic. 😅\n\nHappy playing!"

The advanced gunplay (which is a bit more realistic) mixed with the terrain is what forces you to strategize and use your terrain to your advantage.\n\nDid I mention that you can make awesome and absolutely sick plays because the guns are so balanced that almost every gun one taps you when you're hit in the head? You spawn with a StarterPistol that will down you when you're hit in the head, but won't kill you. You will he downed if ur character's hp drops below 20.\n\nOh, and you can make a base and raid other bases too. It's not like Rust where you need expensive explosives to blow a hole in their base to then breach, instead it's just go over to their base, have a firefight, break their spawners and live on. Although you can use C4 found in airdrops to sabotage a base's production of guns or break their spawners before killing them with your gun.\n\nOkay. Enough yapping.

I even remember stupid self-appointed rivalries that I never ever vocalised but for some weird reason, they reciprocated. I remember when there was a sudden rise in users not hacking to ruin the game by cheating but just to make stupid jokes. I remember the time when there was no trading so you had to sell limiteds for $1 and hope the person who bought it was actually the person you're trading with. I remember the incredibly dedicated RPing communities even if the stories we played out were incredibly cringey. I remember those glorious Egg Hunts where getting a fab egg actually meant something.\n\nIf you want to do a \"History of Roblox\" you should focus on one aspect, like the progress of the engine, or key events over time, like the first egg hunt or the time tix was removed. Heck you could also do one about the animated Roblox videos/short movies. Roblox's history is so complex and broad it just isn't reasonable to do a general timeline."

Stickmasterluke abandoned + opened source the game because it's wonky. There's no incentive to continually play this game (no gacha, no cosmetics, no shaking keys telling that you're doing a great job, nothing that tells you that you're making progress). Wonky gameplay effectively alienates casual players who don't want to learn how to fight using the game's jankiness. No progression system (points that reset) and no global leaderboard. Too retro and archaic controls. Mobile users don't want to get curb stomped. No pay 2 win mechanics.\n\nTL;DR\n\n>Not gamified enough where younger zoomers will grind and play\n\n>Not robux incentivised enough where roblox sees value in promoting it\n\n>Lack of creator support\n\n>For the longest time, lack of exploiter protection\n\nIt was a very fun game, especially in its heyday, but it's gameplay is very dated and not mobile friendly. There's versions out there that mimic it's gameplay but it doesn't hit the same.\n\nRIP you terribly fun game and community"

Now this is awesome, avid players of a community can now work hard and earn something that is more than just an in-game reward!\n\nThe loosened chat filter is very nice too, so I can finally make game descriptions make sense grammatically without very complicated bypasses, alongside being able to have a real conversation with other human beings, and not sound like a robot"

And maybe ROBLOX will take more advice from the community as it starts to have an older player base. \n\nHonestly I'd like to see this go all the way with things locked behind age. 13+ accounts will remain the same as they've always been, allowed the same access and privileges to everything currently implemented . And there can be one or two new account types based on the amount of age restricted content and how far ROBLOX is willing to go. I could see a 16+ account flag have the ability to use some curse words and join some age restricted games, and then another 18+ user flag that removes all restrictions but also keeps other 16+ and 18+ accounts among each other with the 16+ users who decide to play exclusively with older players. Essentially splitting the site into two instances. One for older players and one for the younger players where the older players have an option to join the 13+ instance to play with younger family members, because let's be real... Once you turn 18 should you really be playing ROBLOX regularly with specific kid \"friends\" younger than 13...? Not too sure how common this is, I've never heard of predatory behavior on the site, and I've been on it since 2008, but it's good to have security in place especially if the community is going to open up again to old players who have grown older.\n\nI'm not saying I want ROBLOX to turn into an IMVU clone, although it's always been one in one way or another. That's arguably one of the reasons ROBLOX became what it is today in the first place. But I am VERY excited for the possibilities."

      "comment_body": "I don't say that because I hate them. I realize ROBLOX is a kids game I'm not ignorant, however I know there is appeal for older players too and that is only going to increase with this approach that ROBLOX is taking for them and I'm happy about it."

    {
      "comment_body": "Read u/Ignonym's reply cause that's just not true.\n\nWho do you think makes all the front page games? Most likely older users who are cashing in on the young player base. As older players come back, current devs who are older can start focusing on making more fulfilling content instead of some highschool roleplay, and older devs can get back into studio and learn all the changes then make something they couldn't have dreamed of 10 years ago.\n\nThese changes are definitely going to bring higher quality games to the front page. What 18, 19, 20 year old wants to play adopt \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and hangout with prepubescent children?"

    {
      "comment_body": "Yeah but I suppose that's subjective. I am certainly one of those people however that preferred \"old ROBLOX\" mostly for it's simplicity. The website was much easier to navigate and had a \"ROBLOX aesthetic\" to me that is synonymous with old ROBLOX itself.\n\nNow the website is comparable to modern social media sites, and the community is far more social media-esqe. Everyone seems to fit in a category of player and many of them just treat ROBLOX as a place to act like someone they're not often times coming across as very naïve about the things they use to define them. Back in the day everyone knew we were younger than 18, however most people, the ones who were listened to and respected anyway, acted older than their age. I can safely say I learned proper punctuation and honed some of my grammatical skills early on because I felt it was important to be respected and listened to by my friends.\n\nI also was talking to people who were 14,15,16 when I was 9,10,11 pretending to be their age so maybe my view is a little skewed, I'm not saying there weren't obnoxious children still. I do think though that kids often tried to put on an older front which resulted in a better and more memorable in a positive way. \n\nI know it's just a different way of \"acting like something you're not\" but it's definitely more positive in my humble opinion and produced a better player base."

Perception, especially with parents of young kids, may be more important than fact especially when it comes to video games. Now, roblox is viewed as a pretty safe place for younger kids to play. My kid will join up with his friends, sometimes up to a half dozen kids and play roblox or minecraft together, and us parents spend a good amount of money letting them buy things on those platforms. \n\nWill we be comfortable with the platform if it becomes more adult oriented, even if there are securities in place? I don't know and I have my doubts; again, perception. But it probably won't matter if they get more 17+ players to replace the young kids that may leave.\n\nI would imagine Roblox has a lot of money and resources, I wonder if it would be more wise to keep roblox more kid friendly and come up with an older democratic focused secondary platform. Giving older people freedom for 17+ content while preserving roblox as a more comfortable place for young kids (and thier parents). \n\nJust spitballing thoughts here. I'm no video game expert, just a parent who's kid plays roblox."

I check back in on the game periodically so I guess I'm separate from the older audience who these updates are aiming to bring back, but ROBLOX only became a joke kids game around 2014, 2015. Before then it was not all that popular, definitely not as popular as it was now. But all the social media trends over the years just added fuel to the fire. In terms of bringing a new demographic in with ROBLOX memes who have no intention other than fucking with other people, and internet trends that gave them new material so they didn't have to *actually* be funny, it was already done for them. All of this is what ultimately made ROBLOX the cesspool it is today so I do see what you mean.\n\nHowever I doubt I'm the only one who still checks in to the game, definitely not the only \"OG\" player on the sub, and I do think there are plenty of my age that do miss the times they had on the game and would love to come back if it catered more to our adult interests, and allowing us to actually be adults. Allowing cursing and all these other things are just the first steps. Plus we can't disregard all of the kids who joined in 2012-2015 who are getting older now and would love these updates themselves. I think that's reason in itself for ROBLOX to advertise it properly. They have the money. They could run a HUGE advertising campaign that if done right would reel all us older players back in just like WoW classic did. We all saw the tweets when that was announced...\n\nSorry for the wall of text no tl;dr I tried to keep it short already. I guess I really just feel good about this change as a person who actively wants to play ROBLOX again and have wanted to for years, but just not in the games current state."

You see the words *BLOXY COLA* on the front, and then a small asterisk that stated *ENERGY DRINK*. You remember that this same beverage was used in its source game, ROBLOX, to recover hit points. You wonder if, when you drink it, you can heal your wound and evade becoming one of the monsters. You pop it open with a little _crack!_ and put it to your lips. You attempt to sip it as slowly as possible, to savor it and to avoid the attention of the creatures. You breathe in, then...\n\n#SSSSSLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRP... gasp HHHHHHAAAAUUUHH"

Now I guess you're one of these players who thinks English is the only spoken language in the Universe, well you've got the answer. (It is \"no\", just to clarify)\n\nBesides, even if the sound is barely a second long, there's some great audio softwares that let you see the frequency of the sound through a monitor. Therefore, visual comparisons can be done and yes, it is visually similar to an Enderman getting punch.\n\nYet why not, if that can make you happy or if you can pretend that you're superior to a random redditor on r/roblox, the sound sounds like Enderman Hit (Nr.4 | Minecraft Sound) - Sound Effect for editing.\n\nEdit : In case anyone wants to take a lithen by themselves : [Enderman Hit (Nr.4 | Minecraft Sound) - Sound Effect for editing.](https://youtu.be/BWFcpf8wBEk) ——— [The new default death sound](https://youtu.be/q9skvtpxNCs)"

If somebody walks up to me, and tells me they're quitting roblox because they changed the death sound, I'd laugh in their face, that's how foolish people are being. My downvotes prove my point exactly. People are petty, and they don't want to admit it.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just a sound effect. If anyone is legitimately considering quitting roblox over this, they're a fool. I'm not trying to be an asshole, it's just the facts.

Especialy at this type of games.\n\nThe game right now is meant for old pbb players, not for new ones, meaning it gains a lot less players than it could gain.\n\nAlso, looking at how hoverboards are now and with trainer mastery the game is just a robux game. You need to pay money to be cooler, to have a more fun online expirience. I dont want it to be fully free, the devs can make money, but there is just too much. Its too grindy and people just spend less robux on it.\n\nThe farming feature (old daycare) is also ruined, its located in a terrible area, without any attractions near by.\n\nThe day care was near submarine and near skate park where you could glitch to the up of the map or swim or fish while hatching eggs.\n\nNow, theres nothing.

The community nowdays is toxic and you find either tryhards or complete 1 year olds that dont know how to play, the amount of stupidity, scams, copied, effortless or just not fun to play games is insane, roblox is sometimes getting boring to play because of that, to the point i only play difficulty chart obbies, Funky Friday, Flee The Facility and Murder Mystery 2, but i dont play too much MM2 because of the toxic teamers and i would play arsenal but my net cant handle it, so yes, i miss the 2016 roblox community and games, not the lag and FPS, but the tiny bit of fun i had yeah"

This made for simpler games, yet more replayable due to how drastically different the physics can end up being, it made it an actual sandbox games. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt may also be the nature of the more modern Roblox games I play.\n\nWhen I see Phantom Forces, I think knockoff Battlefield/CoD. When I see Tower Defense Simulator, I think knockoff BTD6. When I see Rise of Nations, I think knockoff Europa Universalis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I look at Doomspire Brickbattle, I see at as a knockoff of another game. It stands on its own feet, not to be compared to other games. When I look at Natural Disaster Survival, you see the same here."

UGC makes cool hats every now and them, but making \"meme\" hats knowing they'll be a fad after months (same can be said with Roblox and the Doge hats, although they got a resurgence somehow) feels like a waste of time, they do it because they know people will buy it.

ROBLOX has made a lot of positive change as well, so I'm not implying that it \"only went downhill\". \n\nWould I like to experience old ROBLOX again for memories sake? Yes, of course I would, it was my childhood after all! Does that mean I'm not open to progression? No, it doesn't, I'm all for ROBLOX pushing new boundaries. \n\nI suppose the simplest way I can convey my thoughts is that, it feels strange seeing a site you've loved and cherished for so long change so dramatically over ten years. That's all."

I couldn’t care less about anyone on roblox, as long as they don’t get mad at me for not having an avatar like them. Which is pretty easy to do, considering how I look in a game literally does not effect you in any way. I’ve encountered self proclaimed “OGs”, slenders and users with limited hats. You’ll get shamed by OGs for having robloxian 2.0. And then the other two will call you poor and probably, call you kid. In toxic communities like these, I hate when people try to guess your age. I don’t mind if you argue with some teenager. But if you just found out that person you’re arguing is below 11-12, then it’s better to give an advice even if they don’t accept it. You can hope they keep your advice in mind, and stop arguing after that. It really doesn’t help if you become a bigger dick if you find out they’re kids."

Roblox refuses to actually work on their own game, and has decided to let it rot and just take the money, instead of investing some of it and making it good.  \nedit; maybe try making more than 1 point and not gaslighting ur opponent? just a thought"

The roblox community also learned how to use the small amount of hats they had to mesh with their colors, this is also kinda robloxs fault due to them making good hats\n\n2010-2015: The community started gaining more and more items and more and more clothing but they still managed to make it mesh with the colors on their avatar and still make it visually appealing, also new heads which is nice\n\n2016-2019: The avatars started to look *cool* instead of looking appealing and nice to look at, people stop to care about the things that made 2007-2015 avatars great althought some still hold on to the principles of those eras\n\n2020-: A magnifaction of 2016-2019"

If you would look at the pictures from 2006-2019, the avatars were beautiful and colorful, but in present which is last pic, it’s not colorful. It looks bland and almost same taste, as in no one has different taste anymore, just same copy and paste. As a 2014 player of roblox, I genuinely loved the old avatars.

If you want a more tame experience, you can go to place 1, which is a lot more calm."

I think 144x72 at 0.5fps of a live feed is already pretty good, and even with a better connection you might run into the Roblox engine part-updates-per-second limit or whatever it would be called."

      "comment_body": "Idea for a game you could make with this:\n\nWhen you spawn you can choose between a few weapons. These could be swords, bats, fryingpans, fists, etc.\nYou will have a health and stamina meter. Using a weapon will take a very small amount of stamina. Some weapons deal stamina damage too, like bat's, while stuff like swords are more HP damage. If you run out of stamina you would get flung in the direction opisate diraction from where you got hit. \nYou could maybe add utility items too, so you can choose a weapon and utility at spawn. Utilities could be stuff like vitamins that give stamina, health kits that heal, and grappling hooks. These would have a cooldown after use.\n\nThe game would take place on top of skyskraper buildings. Imagine something like the map in the game \"Parkour\". This means that if you jump from a high skyskraper to a smaller one, then you might break that buildings floor and fall into it. So, there will be rooftop and building combat. Stuff like bat's will fling you alot, so you could fling people out through building windows etc.\n\nI think you alredy get a picture of what the game could be."

In the first episode, a talking sketchbook teaches the 3 protagonists about creativity, and at one point asks them about their favorite colors. The Yellow Guy mentions that his favorite color is green, and to that the sketchbook replies with \"Green is not a creative color.\" It, and the other sentient objects that show up throughout the 6 episodes to teach the protagonists, all harrass the Yellow Guy in various ways, so it can be inferred that the sketchbook only called green uncreative to lower the Yellow Guy's spirits.\n\nHope that clears it up. For a lot of DHMIS fans the \"green uncreative\" thing is a shared joke so you'll probably see that statement a lot online."
